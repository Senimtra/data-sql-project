will share with you my terrible experience with Ironhack hoping that it will be useful to you and that you will not make the mistake I made  I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones  even ignoring them   thinking that these were just exceptions  people who did not want to learn something new  But now I know they were people telling the truth  I don t want to offend anyone  I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it  So let s begin  1  The Teacher   Ignacio Soretas He can t speak English properly  He has a hard time understanding what we said  of course  I understand that English is not his mother language  but this is not just about pronunciation  it s about the word combination he uses  He just lacks the ability to explain  to express himself correctly  Also  if you ask him a question  either verbal or written  he cannot understand what you are asking him  he cannot answer the question  It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways  just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense  Things that have nothing to do with the question  Example  Question  Hey Ignacio  how to clean this data  Answer  It s very important to clean your data  OR I don t understand what you re asking   It flows from topic to topic  Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say  but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them  Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean  Let s imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza  I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that s why I chose this example  Here s how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza  Example  Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza  then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time  I forgot to tell you that he had no children  take the pizza out of the oven and eat  This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives  It was easy to detect the catch  but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis  statistics etc  It s impossible to understand what he means  but he left you with confusion with many questions    2  Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we re not explained  Things like how to create a table  Data Frame  in Pandas  Python library used to operate with data  How to fill this table with information  How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff  The biggest downside is that they didn t teach us to THINK like a data analyst  they didn t teach us how to ask questions and how to check them  through the data  how to clean data  and many many more    Also  the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners  Task descriptions are very bad  it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker  Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life  Things that have nothing to do with us  Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task  For example  things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters  We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them  Like  Who is the strongest Pokemon  As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon  the difficulty of the task increases  Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work  with which you are trying to process the table  It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life  things that we encounter every day  such as tables with information about food and so on    The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud  and there was nothing of added value  Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4 5 hours from 9 to 14 00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head  The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals  not a lot of information together    Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher  Well  this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros    SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst  well we learn it only for one week  but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands  and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don t understand how they work  Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day  ONLY ONE DAY  yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY    3  Job support is even worst  I will tell you only that few months later I can t find a job in the analytics field  and I will end there  hopefully  I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack    Of course  there are many more bullshits around them but yea  that s enough for now  As a summary  STAY AWAY from IRONHACK  STAY AWAY from IRONHACK  Go

and bootcamps on the world  but from online courses you can get refunds super easily if you dont like something  so its easier to select out the trash  With bootcamps you pay thousands of dollars with no hope of a refund if its shit TLDR  Overall experience I m not sure what I expected from this  I was new to the field and wanted to jump in somehow  just learning a few hours every now and then was not really effective  So in a way it was good  because I spent the time on learning  not on playing games etc  Also i did not have to work during the 10 week with full salary because of covid  So i only regret it halfsy Don t do any bootcamps if you can sit down by yourself to study read stuff  The only reason to pick a bootcamp is because you can t get yourself to sit down and learn  If you can

set of skills and made me a much better engineer Experience summary  High workload  High complexity on the topics  So many new and useful things learned  Machine Learning module is awesome  but short  Very competent teaching staff  Super responsible and caring administrative staff  Cool extra seminars along the bootcamp  for example  Build an ETL Pipeline  Build a Django App  Beer and pizza offered by IronHack on events   Detailed experience The program is very well distributed  The first weeks were mainly dedicated to learn basic programming and to clean data in Python  Since  data cleaning is such an important feature on a Data Scientist  the program has a very intensive approach on this subject  Very cool and useful  We also spent a few days learning SQL  which is great  because it gives you a feel of the data warehousing task  Then  we learned how to manipulate data and make it  readable  for everyone  using super interesting data visualization libraries and software  At this point  we were only at the first part of the bootcamp  The workload was really high and the tasks were not easy  but I was learning so much  I thought it couldn t get more difficult  but then  second part of the bootcamp came on After this point not only the workload increased  but the complexity of the subjects studied also increased  We started going deep on Statistics  This was a very challenging and important part of the bootcamp  since Statistics are one of the stepping stones of Data Analytics  The last weeks were dedicated to the coolest topic  in my opinion    Machine Learning  We got to learn multiple algorithms and techniques to develop prediction projects  In the last project on campus  2 weeks project  we had to develop a Machine Learning Model and present our results  I was really happy and excited on the last weeks  cause I got to see and feel the potential of an amazing technology like Machine Learning  However  I got the feeling that we needed to dedicate more time on the Machine Learning module  The program should be reviewed in the sense that it should dedicate more time to study Deep Learning  The teaching staff was very competent  We had 4 teachers available   1 lead teacher and 3 assistant teachers  They were really good educating and there was always someone available to help  Very effective teaching system Besides the technical characteristics and the

the final project is for a real client  and that allows you to fail and learn  Your fellow students will be one of your strengths  Cons    The bootcamp is intensive  the pace is steady and fast  you need to know that  and to know yourself  before jumping into such a course  It is much better to have a stable and supportive personal environment when you start a bootcamp like this one  Be prepared  and manage your energy  amp  time  it s a both a marathon and a sprint    There s a lot to learn in a small amount of time  you have to love learning  and to be able to stay attentive in a classroom environment    If you struggle with digital tools and concepts  you will be hindered by this  So  all in all  a great experience  not for everyone of course  but that can prove useful to kickstart a new career in UX UI Design   I must state that I come from an IT background  and that I am comfortable with the activity of learning things in a classroom'),(59,1,5,'Dafne

background where I learned many of the tools we used during the Bootcamp but applied in different contexts  I want to share with you some   of the main insights after having lived this experience  PROS   The Ironhack crew is incredible  everyone is kind and understanding  and always open to help    They emphasize the importance of mental health during the Bootcamp  I really appreciated that    You have a lot of documentation for all of the different topics touched during the Bootcamp    Careerhack guidelines and tools are on top  CONS   The pace is fast  Keep in mind that it will feel like jumping from one thing to the next  but at some point everything will connect  trust me    The format is not adapted to different types of learning  The motto is  learn by doing  which is great  But if you are a person who learns differently  it might be a little hard for you to grasp the info  since it can be a lot to take in    If it is your first time interacting with subjects like Design Thinking  Lean  etc  It can be a little overwhelming    If you have never used any design software  like Photoshop  Illustrator  etc  you may take a little longer to understand with Figma  I suggest practicing and discovering the software on your own before the Bootcamp  SUGGESTIONS   Organize your days  Do you consider yourself an unorganized person  Find a method that works for you  otherwise  you ll find yourself overwhelmed with many To Dos    Take time for yourself  Find time to do those things that recharge your energy because  as I just mentioned in the previous point  you can easily find yourself feeling overwhelmed    If you have time before the Bootcamp  use it  Go through all the Careerhack tasks  this will make your life easier later  Also  I would definitely contact Alumni to learn about CVs  LinkedIn  Portfolios  or even ask about topics and tools that you don t know or would like to know better  If you do all these things in advance  you ll save a lot of time and feel less overwhelmed  You will learn many things  I hope  and have the opportunity to connect with amazing people with completely different backgrounds and personalities  Find and use methods that work for you  ask for help if needed  keep in mind that communication and empathy will be very important  and enjoy the ride because even though it feels like it will never end  it will  So to conclude  personally this Bootcamp meant a lot to me  academically  professionally  and personally  It helped me get back on track  I learned a lot even though I already knew the tools we were using  and I met incredible people  I totally recommend the UX UI Design Bootcamp at Ironahck'),(60,1,5,'Albane Casalta','False',2022,'False','2022-02-15','2022-02-15','4.7','5.0','5.0','4.0','It s been an amazing

m going to divide my feedback for each one  1  The pre work The pre work needs to be done on Ironhack s platform  The courses are very clear and the exercises manageable on our own  It was intense to   start with  but very important to complete it as it helps a lot to get prepared for the bootcamp  I recommend to take more time than advised if you don t want to do it in a rush  2  The courses  The courses are well constructed and understandable  All of the teaching staff is very professional  understanding and responding to all our questions which is great as we all come from different backgrounds and therefore do not have the same approach to design  We learn theory and practice it through different projects in parallel which is nice to really get into the work and also learn to work on projects with different people  We work on the whole Design Thinking process which gives us the opportunity to practice both UX and UI and get a good knowledge at the end of the bootcamp  3  Careehack  The career week was interesting and we had some good advice for our job research  though very general  It is sad we did not work more practical exercises related to UX UI Design that we can have during job interviews  I also regret the fact that the tool we are given to improve our CVs is not adapted to French CVs and the platform content is not up to date  4  Hybrid campus  We had the opportunity to follow the courses both on the campus  which is very nice  and in remote  I really enjoyed having these 2 options which were both well organized  If I had to give recommendations to anyone who want to start this bootcamp it would be    Be ready to work a lot  but keep in mind it is just for 2 months and then you ll get great new skills    Be open minded and adaptable    Get ready to manage changing emotions  yours and others    Take some time for yourself    Don t be afraid to ask questions  Overall  I had a very good experience at Ironhack Paris  very intense for sure  but

very intense  if you re not into that  it s not for you  maybe take the half time bootcamp not full time  I would advise it to people who are interested but please   be prepared and read a little before  as for students already from a design background might be a little weird for you as it is made more for all types of backgrounds  but it s great overall  as for the one I did  heads up they spoke French sometimes because well duh it s Paris  I do understand French though  took me two weeks to fully adapt but I do understand so if that s a problem for you I don t know maybe check little more before registration depends on the teacher  the teacher did his best but sometimes some words slipped and not all the students are as fluent so yea  But the bootcamp overall was a good experience  I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically  it wasn t that bad  sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience  as for the bootcamp gained knowledge  I feel there is room for improvement but doesn t mean it s bad  it s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest  the staff are super super friendly  man I can t emphasise how good and amazing they were  as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students  my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life  the campus man  I want to live there  top tbh top  that s all pros I guess  I ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge  anyone with previous knowledge  throw that aside and learn from the start then connect  you ll never learn enough with a half filled cup  empty the cup  learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge  As for me tbh  I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn  Another thing is the hybrid mode  I personally loved it  if it s any problem to you  you can attend there and do online together but if you re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers  As for the bootcamp all in all  I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially  this will be good for you  plus you ll be certified  My only problem tbh  might not be my only one  it is while I m writing this because just top of my mind  I know it s long sorry hehe  the money  kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn t allowed to apply them together  some people paid more  some paid less  some didn t pay at all they got full scholarships  which felt weird to be honest  but alas we were there to learn so doesn t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now  at least that s my judgment  I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but

opportunity to change our lives completely  Less than a year ago  I had just arrived in Miami with only one certainty  Despite my interest in the field  I have neither the skills nor the knowledge   to pursue a career in tech  Through the influence of my dearest friend  I build up the courage to start a UX UI Design Bootcamp at Ironhack  In January of 2021  I began my journey in an intense boot camp  with the most creative and passionate students and teachers I had ever met  Suddenly  something that seemed impossible  started becoming true  I was understanding  practicing  and becoming well versed in the best design practices and tools  All of this was thanks to the incredible staff and program that the school offers  There are many forms of indoctrination  different practices  millions of schools  but Ironhack creates an environment of accelerated learning beyond comparison  In addition  the school offers impeccable support in career services  In my 9th week at the Ironhack  I was offered a job as a UX UI Designer and was able to position myself  thanks to the support of Daniel Brito  my career coach  In a nutshell  Ironhack is the perfect place for everyone and anyone  who desires to start a career in tech  I had an amazing experience and in short  time have already started seeing the benefits of my time invested in the course  Ironhack showed me that my only certainty was a fallacy'),(80,1,5,'Anonymous','True',2020,'False','2021-01-18','2021-01-18','2.3','2.0','3.0','2.0','I attended the full time UX UI Design bootcamp at Ironhack last year  I come from a background unrelated to UX UI Design  but wanted to make a career change  I considered different options  including studying at college  but felt like getting out there   and start my career  Reading the very good reviews here at Switchup  I decided to go for Ironhack  Unfortunately  I was naive  Ironhack has a really supporting and helpful community  and the learning by doing methodology resulted in a few case studies that I could showcase in my portfolio after graduating  However  there are a few things I want an aspiring attendee to have in mind  First of all    Ironhack advertises themselves as having a  90  placement rate 180 days after graduation  This is very misleading  The placement rate is calculated by dividing the number of employed students   number of students looking for a job  What they don t mention is that  out of all the graduates  only 68  are job searching  And their definition of  employed  includes Hired in field  Hired out of field   Ironhack Employee  Freelancer  Internships and Entrepreneurs  In reality  it s only 50  of UX UI Design graduates who get a job within UX UI Design after 6 months  I graduated several months ago and only a few people out of 20 in my cohort have managed to get a job at this point  Of course covid 19 complicates everything  but I have applied for 140  jobs  resulting in around 10 interviews  studied theory and completed unpaid internships  and it seems quite hopeless at this point  I recommend reading their number in details here https www ironhack com en news ironhack student outcomes report audited by pwc   Another point that might be implicit when applying for a 10 week bootcamp is that the education is quite shallow  We never learned how to make safe assumptions out of research data  Instead  we angled the research to fit our design idea  This was due to lack of time and lack of knowledge since we never actually learned why we did things on a deeper level  We never got any feedback on our actual design process or design thinking  only on how we presented our design  I think this is a problem since we compete with people with more education and more experience within research and design thinking    The education was very unstructured which became really stressful  We were already expected to put in 60 70 hours a week  but the teachers rarely managed to keep the time  resulting in a huge stress since we every week had to deliver a product design and a great presentation    I will keep applying for jobs and refining my profile  but I would recommend anyone who considers Ironhack to think it through and be a bit skeptical'),(81,1,5,'Tomás Aragão','False',2020,'True','2020-12-15','2020-12-15','5.0','5.0','5.0','5.0','I chose the UX UI Design Bootcamp in Lisbon looking to change

 more than enough guidance and resources to accomplish my goal of landing a job and making a complete career change  This program is called a  bootcamp  for a reason  It is tough and intense  You are learning A LOT each day through lectures and  mostly  project work  However  the instructors are there for you at all times to answer any questions and offer you the proper guidance  The instructors I had were VERY knowledgable about the UX process and best practices  and they were always so patient with those who needed extra time to fully understand the concepts  I never felt intimidated or scared to approach them with any questions or concerns that I had  They created a very inspiring and encouraging classroom environment  Following the examples of our instructors  all of my fellow classmates were always willing to help each other out and pick each other up  By the end of the bootcamp  we had all gotten pretty close and it was honestly hard to say goodbye  Another part of the program I really benefitted from was their Career Services  Brito  the Ironhack Outcomes Manager  is an absolute job and networking guru  Something I really liked about this part was their honesty  They made it clear that if you want to land a job out of this program  then you need to be the one doing the networking and applying  So many bootcamps out there promise that they will hand you a job right out of the program  which is total BS  But Ironhack s approach is to teach you the best methods of networking  applying  interviewing  and setting up your LinkedIn  Rather than catching a fish for you  they teach you how to fish  I was able to land a really good Product Design job within a month of graduating  However  landing a job takes some people longer than others  I can honestly say that this program changed my life for the better  I was working in farms and restaurants prior to this  barely getting by on my hourly pay  and now I have landed a permanent role with a great salary and benefits  I am forever grateful for Ironhack and owe them so much  Last but not least I do want to say  this program isn t a walk in the park  It is a lot of work and very stressful at times  but

solely on UI  which is what any entry level designer will be expected to do  During the course  we also focused on learning to code  which  sure was useful but did not need to be a priority in the

expanding my design career  The 9 weeks were very intense both in and out of the classroom  It s a bootcamp after all  The curriculum is substantial and it s virtually impossible   to go over every topic at any given week  which was frustrating to me as I wanted to have lectures and learn about everything  I put in a good 12 hour day studying schedule and that included weekends working on my case studies  doing research and catching up on the design challenges and lectures not talked about in the classroom  I quickly realized that at the end of the day you get what you put in  If you don t take it seriously and are diligent about completing all your assignments  research  case studies  presentations and blog posts on time you will be wasting your time  money and resources  The staff is nice and courteous  my instructor David was very knowledgeable with tons of experience as a seasoned designer who worked hard to get us a well known company to work with us for our final project  My TAs Nicole and Maikel were one of the best I ve ever had  equally resourceful  friendly and amazing professionals  The facilities are pretty good  located in a co working space building where a few tech companies operate  which is cool  There are daily treats offered by the building  a vending and a coffee machine  and a nice kitchen where you can have your meals plus plenty of restaurants close by  Also  several rooms and areas are available within the building to work on your assignments outside the classroom which was very helpful since I often stayed late working on my projects Career services is one of the best things Ironhack has to offer  Daniel Brito  the outcomes manager is constantly teaching workshops and having one on ones with you to make sure you are following his directions and preparing for your new career  Once you re done with the cohort  there s a career week where you sit through lectures and dedicate time to work on your LinkedIn profile  portfolio website and interview techniques among other things  The last week of the cohort is dedicated to a hiring fair where local companies come to an event organized by Daniel to interview students for work opportunities  I m happy my hard work paid off as I was hired shortly after by one of the companies I interviewed with In conclusion  Ironhack will teach you a comprehensive curriculum  give you valuable tools in a nice environment  help you find a job to launch your UX UI career and offer you a lifelong platform to always be current and part of the tech industry but you need to be dedicated

the name says  Absolutely energy draining and very stressful  but you really get what you put in  A huge advantage in the digital   job market  Never learned so many important key concepts and technologies before in my life in such a short timespan  I already had a job in the digital industry and quite some experience  but lacked the ability to code and understand code myself  The bootcamp curriculum and student material is top notch  you get plenty of opportunities to practice and put literally everything you learn to the test with very helpful support on demand from the teachers and assistant teachers  JavaScript is absolutely key and the prowess you gain is immense  Never at any point did something I learn feel like   Yeah  we just do it because it s in the curriculum    Everything was relevant for the job and really all modules complemented each other perfectly  However  I must say that the lectures and live codealongs were very energy draining due to the length  like 6 7 hours at a time  and the homework just put alot of extra workload on the students  backs  My eyes really hurt from the long screentime  although I m super used to work computer jobs  Getting blocked after the teacher s working hours can be very frustrating  when nobody s really there to help and you need to finish mandatory homework  I expected something like a 40 45 hr week  but ended up getting more like a 60 hour work week  including weekends  For fast students it will feel like you are being slowed down by less advanced students  often there is no way to learn the lesson for the day self paced self guided  though you could sometimes get permission to do that  The teacher s assistants are alumni  and if you are their first cohort  you will sometimes know that it s first time  when troubleshooting doesn t go that smoothly  If you are unlucky  it can sometimes not feel like the most professional experience  Otherwise  the organization is well run  the managers and lead teachers are super open to feedback and adapt quickly  everyone was always super friendly  polite and patient  For anyone who is willing to sacrifice a lot of energy  some health and social life for 3 months to go from zero to hero   DO IT  The experience was extremely rewarding  but also comes at a price  You can definitely change careers with this bootcamp  and if you want to upskill to reach new

la légère  car elle permet de s habituer à son rythme aux nouveaux languages qui seront étudiés pendant le cursus  compter une soixantaine d heures pour tout réaliser  Le programme est très axé sur le JavaScript  ce qui permet de développer la logique nécessaire à la programmation  Il est important  voir indispensable  de lire les cours du lendemain  afin de se familiariser avec les nouvelles notions quotidiennes  C est un travail supplémentaire certes  mais c est une étape importante pour ne pas décrocher pendant le bootcamp   Le rythme étant vraiment très soutenu  un moment d inattention peut faire perdre beaucoup de temps ensuite  pour revoir la notion qui a été laissée de côté  Il est important de se rendre compte que  pendant ces deux mois  on parcourt énormément de notions différentes  de concepts nouveaux et de logiques auxquelles nous ne sommes pas forcément habitués  C est très dense  et pourtant  ce n est que la partie émergée de l iceberg   Ironhack prépare très bien au métier de dev  mais c est à chacun d approfondir ses connaissances en parallèle  Au delà du programme  l espace de travail est cool  espace partagé  type WeWork  le staff d Ironhack est vraiment sympa et dispo si besoin  Mentions spéciales aux soirées Iron Beer du vendredi soir  qui permettent de décompresser ensemble après une semaine bien chargée  C est aussi l occasion d échanger avec toute la promo  les élèves des autres formations  et de développer un réseau de pros et d amis  Car c est bien là l une des forces de ce bootcamp   se donner à 2000   pendant plusieurs semaines  travailler dur  travailler dur et encore travailler dur  mais travailler dur et apprendre avec des personnes qui ont le même objectif et qui passent par les mêmes galères  être épaulé par une équipe

although some of the students gathered at the school location  But the fact that it was online did not hinder the learning experience in   any way  the teacher and TA were still able to help us efficiently through Zoom  The curriculum tries to be as practical as possible  to better equip for the job market  So it doesn t really give in depth explanations on computer science  or how the language  in my case JavaScript  actually works  etc  We learned the really basic things we need to know in order to not feel lost when we learn more by ourselves  The program is very practical   when we learned something in the morning  we directly applied it during the lab in the afternoon which helped me learn better  The labs were self guided and had a lot of instructions  so doing the labs by myself often helped me understand the concepts studied in class better than when the teacher explained it  Doing a 2 months bootcamp doesn t make a solid developer  it s only 2 months  but it gives you enough basics that you can learn by yourself after and quickly become a solid junior developer  At the end of the bootcamp  the teacher told us that the only way to become a good developer is just continuous practice and learning  You have to be willing to go and learn above the bootcamp s basic curriculum if you want a good position fast  Ironhack helps us a lot to get jobs after the bootcamp

impressions a few days after completing the web development bootcamp at Ironhack in Paris  Before the bootcamp started I had to complete a pre work course which is a series of online lessons and exercises to learn the basics of HTML  CSS and   Javascript  100  hours of work later  I had already learned so much that I was under the impression that the bootcamp was going to be a walk in the park  I couldn t be more wrong  Although the pre work seemed a lot  I had only started to scratch the surface of what is needed to become a full stack developer  The bootcamp is only 9 weeks long but it felt more like 9 months because if you want to follow the pace you have to dedicate all your time and energy to it  nights and weekends included  The structure of the bootcamp is as follows  every morning you learn new concepts and skills  every afternoon you do a guided project   called  lab    to put the lesson into practice  The labs are challenging and put you in real life work situations so it s a fantastic way to learn  There are sometimes solo labs  sometimes group labs so you can practice working on your own as well as with a team of developers  At the end of every 2 weeks  you have 1 week to develop a project of your own with a couple of teammates to test your skills and start building your portfolio  During the entire bootcamp you get the support of super skilled teachers  They always look for the right balance between helping you when you get stuck on a problem and letting you find the solution for yourself so that you do not only learn to blindly apply concepts but genuinely understand them  Overall  I had a fantastic experience at Ironhack  Yes  it s been intense but I could not have learned this much in such a short time with another format  Thank you to all the Ironhack staff and to the students of the web dev cohort 102 for making this bootcamp so enjoyable'),(181,1,7,'Myriam

There are teacher assistants to help you  and a nice balance of solo and group projects  I think one of the most important things these days would be the adaptation to covid related issues  The bootcamp was flexible  possible to go to the campus  or to work remotely whenever you want  and this gave me the opportunity to save 3 hours  of commute everyday  so I could focus on the labs and rest

Miami s full time web development bootcamp this March and I can t recommend it enough  I was very hesitant at first to join any sort of bootcamp  I looked into it a few years ago and compared them all  I weighed pros and cons   and in the end always thought I could make it without the help of a bootcamp so I just waited and pretended that I would start the job search eventually but two years later I was still unemployed  I got an email from OfferUp announcing their partnership with Ironhack and it piqued my interest  I gave it a shot and won a partial scholarship which was enough to offset the interest fees from the loan  I was also able to get approved for the loan by one of their financing partners despite having a very poor credit score and high credit utilization which was a blessing  As the title of my review says  I had already been programming since I was a teenager  I ve worked on several multiplayer game mods and even created games  programs and websites of my own  Being self taught is great  There was one big drawback however  I could not find a job  My resume was awful  I did not know how to network nor the true importance of networking  I had no clue how to sell myself or how to talk to recruiters  It was obvious to me that joining a bootcamp would not make me gain any significant technical skills considering my extensive background  I already had a fair understanding of the material being taught and could have brushed up those skills within a week or two  So why did I join Ironhack  Simply for the one and only Daniel Brito from Ironhack s Career services  Throughout the bootcamp  I was able to schedule one on one meetings with him in order to discuss my career goals as well as get advice on how to approach certain companies and very good interview preparation help  I always had so many questions prepared for him yet I only needed to ask him one question and he would predict my next 2 3 questions and answer them in advance  He really knows his stuff  As soon as Brito walked us through updating our LinkedIn profiles  I was assaulted by recruiters left and right and didn t know what to do  He pointed me in the right direction  told me what to watch out for and what to expect  He gave me the confidence that I needed to aim high and shoot for the positions I didn t see myself achieving for another 5 years  Thanks to his guidance  I landed a job two weeks before graduating as a DevOps engineer for an amazing company who works with what is in my opinion the best tech stack you can have in 2021  Compared to other bootcamps that say you don t pay until you get hired  or worse  the ones that take a percentage of your salary  Ironhack was the only clear viable choice for me  I knew full well going into it that I was there for Brito first and foremost and to make great connections second  I ve created some relationships that I hope to carry with me for life not only with fellow students but with my teacher Niko as well  I can t say enough about the teacher I had  Honestly I have never seen a teacher so passionate when it comes to his student s success  Most teachers would traditionally stop and go MIA as soon as the clock turns over or your time in the bootcamp is up  but not at Ironhack  Niko and I actually started a passion project together which is aimed at helping students stay in touch and keep learning and connecting with others even post graduation  I think that speaks for itself in the amount of care that goes into your learning experience  You ll never feel like you re just a number on a spreadsheet that needs to get a grade  If you are in the same situation I was four months ago meaning you are passionate about code  are self taught and have been struggling to enter the professional world or are

and friendly  and they won t hesitate to stay longer in the zoom to help you with projects labs  which is really appreciated Regarding their technical   knowledge  sometimes I felt they lacked it when we asked questions in depth  Our cohort was about 15  students and we only had one teacher and one TA  who graduated from Ironhack just a few months before  so his knowledge was quite limited  especially for the projects  This was inconvenient because several times we had to  wait in line  to get someone to help us debug our code  after we spent at least 30 min  if not more  without success  Also  it is super intense and I truly believe that 9 weeks is too short to really learn all that s offered in the curriculum and fully understand  Some topics are briefly discussed but they require a lot more of self study after the bootcamp as in between sessions we re too busy with the evening labs  which take hours to solve  trust me Keep in mind that in the full time bootcamp  there s no day in between each class where you can see deeper some concepts  Every day is super challenging and we re moving onto new subjects quickly  so it s super important to keep your head out of the water and ask questions until you fully understand  otherwise you will miss a lot of knowledge The technologies studied are overall good for the current job market except for Mongo DB  non relational DB  which I wouldn t recommend because it s a and nowadays relational DB  like mySQL  are more in demand on job offers Regarding the career week  to me  it sounded like a joke  From their marketing campaigns  it looks like they ll arrange for you interviews with companies they have an agreement with  based on their  algorithm  but in fact in that week  you basically learn how to make a CV and a cover letter  and they keep repeating to you that you should use your network and that they won t help you if you don t do your part of the job and complete all the tedious tasks on the student portal One great thing was the ambiance with the other students and those from other cohorts  Especially during a very intense bootcamp where your brain is overwhelmed  it was nice  even remotely  to get to  virtually  meet up  play games  etc Overall I don t regret the experience of a coding bootcamp because I learned a lot and that gave me a great push for a career in development  but don t fool yourself  you need to work a lot more and for many more months before you get a job in development unless you have coding experience prior to the bootcamp A coding bootcamp is really not for everyone  If you re really determined to get a job right after  you better start working months before enrolling Also  considering the price  I really think it s a rip off  unless you get a substantial scholarship  The price for the on site bootcamp and the remote one are almost the same which is not justifiable as by learning remotely  you don t use any location from Ironhack  you use your own desk  electricity  internet  etc  and even for the events  you re bringing your own beer  Honestly  there are plenty of other schools that offer similar curriculums for a much lower price  especially for the remote course  Ironhack doesn t offer anything really exceptional or differenc from other school on the market nowadays'),(187,1,7,'salim

transitioned really fast to the remote learning setup and it was seamless  I know they are considering offering remote classes as a standard now  and I couldn t recommend it more  You get to spend

  only study with them for 2 months   you will remember and know for the rest of your life  I am writing this review 2 years after finishing my bootcamp  One of the things I remember reading about  which I kind of doubted before starting  was the friendship everyone said you develop with co participants  and how tight you become as a group  I was proven wrong  The Ironhack staff of Berlin almost forced us to become good friends  Now now  hear me out  After a first day of introduction games  name games and an already overwhelming amount of work  the participants would go out together and have a drink  And after a hard day s work  and on every Friday  we would do the same  We had pair programming everyday during classes and did independent projects in pairs or trios  The work is so intense  and you spend so much time with your peers  that by the time the first week is over  it will feel like you ve already known the others for a long time  You end up with a sort of  us against the work mentality because of the sheer amount  where you just have to band together to beat the monster that is the Daily Exercise  I feel that I don t really need to say much about the effectiveness of Ironhack s teaching  I got a job after 1 month  I had zero prior coding skills  or even math skills  just an interest for gaming and technology  Most of my cohort got a job in way less time  many even before the camp ended  I got to be a help teacher after my bootcamp and can give a few tips  as some of the difficulties students had were similar in the next group    Read up and get as good as you can before the bootcamp  I was not particularly well prepared  I would say average to below average skill level  and had to work that much more  Don t do what I did  Don t procrastinate the pre work  The workload is massive  and  getting back on track  when you start off track is really  really hard    Additionally  go out with the other participants  Get a beer  or ten  Switch places in the classroom  Say yes to all the outings and beers and lunches and whatnot  Remember that when you re done there  your skill level is only one part of the picture  Your network and friendships are the stuff you actually remember  And practially speaking  I now have multiple contacts within the tech industry from all around the world  So make it a good experience by having fun  and not drowning in the work  and it s a win win  Take some distance  Take at least one day off per week  Don t  use the weekend to get back on track   you will say this at some point  You will need the time off in the

It was a lot of hard work   a lot of homework  a lot of things to learn in so short time  and a lot of code to submit that same night  Very little hours   of sleep and usually thinking and dreaming about code My story started with company lay off  so I was unemployed looking for job and counting my money and looking for a way to make it last  a friend of mine recommended me IronHack   you could change carriers as I did    that sounded good   and at least it could be an attractive boost to my current skills  I was having doubts but the day I payed the bootcamp a visit they talk me about some financing options  so I took some days to do my budget and gave it a green light  I enrolled in the next FT bootcamp  As I mentioned early  it was hard and challenging  if you have zero coding background  math is not that important  you better enroll in the part time bootcamp  if you had some coding subjects in school you just need to apply  a lot  yourself  if you know how to code but you want to learn fast and with help the bootcamp stack then it is a very good jump start for learning the language and the tools  Maybe you come from a different background that is not technology  if that is your case consider first the halftime bootcamp because it can get frustrating how little time you have and how many things you got to learn and how complex are the projects you have to deliver  My lead teachers were very good  very young  considering the average of my career teachers  but they were awesome coders and dedicated about teaching   sometimes a little cocky  my teacher assistants were good maybe sometimes hard to find or not as crafty as one would like  they were always well intentioned even the times the fix they gave you crashed your code  but every bootcamp has different teachers and assistants so only fortune can tell who your teachers are going to be  One thing I can tell you  yes the program will include the most fitted technologies to go and search for a job and enough knowledge to get you started as an entry level programmer  depending on how easy if for you to build upon those skills is who much more you can achieve in your job search  the other skills that you learned before also add up to that  In few words my bootcamp experience was very good just remember  you need to be up to the task  About my job quest and job support experience  I can tell you that my job support has been very good  very unique times  covid pandemic  to be looking for job  I notice that the technology market keeps growing and keeps hiring people at least more than the other markets some of them  are shrinking or paused  so I cannot tell at this moment if the same rules of the year before apply to my future job and salary offers  but I m glad the Tech and coding market is still hiring and growing  It is a great and outstanding work and support the one being made by the  hiring support team  I can tell that it makes a difference in your favor to have them    I notice because I pass many months looking for job by myself before the bootcamp  so it is awesome to have them once you finish the bootcamp  It is not a walk in the park  it is still demanding looking for a job but the burden is less  Is it worth it   well  short answer YES  is not cheap   try looking for a scholarship or financing help  the end is just the beginning  as you finish the bootcamp you notice that there are SO many different technologies  tools and languages out there that it gets a little overwhelming  so look into the things you like and apply yourself on learning those new things

have very mixed feelings about the experience  I will try to be as honest as possible  Before the course starts  students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform   The platform was a good start but didn t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material  The TAs are available to help  but in my experience they didn t always get back to me right away  I later learned why the TAs are extremely overworked  The prework needs improving because there s no good way to accurately see if you ve learned enough before the course starts  even by completing the two assignments  As for the course itself  class was from 9 18 00 but if you re taking it seriously  you ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments  It s lots of self learning  The website is accurate in its structure of the day  with lectures and labs interspersed  They re good at giving you lots of breaks  which you ll need  The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you  sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code  Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay credit  On the other hand  the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners  it s hard to know if you truly understand the material  You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others  so it s hard to gauge whether you ve comprehended it all  Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire project because I didn t understand any of it  while the feedback from the TAs was very positive  I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn t truly see how people were doing  When I tried to advocate for myself  they always just told me I was fine  The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career  You ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio  Additionally  you ll do 1 2 daily labs  mini projects  so you ll build up a good foundation  After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible  IH barely scratches the surface  and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years  especially without help from peers  On the other hand  I personally think IH isn t the right bootcamp anymore  Perhaps it once was  but its career services leave something to be desired  in the case of my class  a career  Our hiring week took place right before Christmas  so it might as well not have happened  as no one hires then anyway  After that  we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating  not nearly enough compared to the services promised  They also weren t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn t instantaneous  and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive  They told me things I already know  More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job  only a small number got hired within those three months  probably well below a 50  hiring rate  or even 30  Overall  a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision  but for the financial and physical and mental health costs  IH is not the best choice'),(272,1,7,'José Maria Barreto

For it being only a month I learned so much and got a better handle on how to code JavaScript  The assessments were really tough but from my struggles I progressed  I don t feel as though I have

with my struggles and didn t give up on me despite how discouraged I felt  He tought us how to think like a developer and to problem solve instead of memorizing code and that is really important  When I couldn t get a problem to pass he would go through and debug with me  The class in itself was very uplifting and I feel like it was a great environment to motivate me to learn'),(401,2,10,'In Hoo

up a terminal  We can say that I was as green to coding as anyone could be  Pre work   As soon as I paid for the course  I was immediately given access to   the Github with all the material  including problem sets  videos  and assessments  For one week  I worked through all the work up until mid week 2  which I would recommend anyone do if they would like to be more prepared than their peers and feel less lost  that will happen regardless if you re new to all of this  My instructor emailed me consistently  and even helped me through the initial phases of just knowing where to type Instructor   Coding people have a  IMO deserved  reputation of not being the best communicators  This was what scared me most about transitioning my career  I did not want to be at the mercy of someone who is crass and can t communicate with people  The instructor  Alvin  and his TA  David  were by far the best people anyone could ask for when it came to teaching the class  Alvin responds to emails usually in less than one hour  if I message him on Slack  far quicker of course  and the way he teaches  there is no way someone can fall behind  Each line of code is explained in bitter detail until everyone has a positive look on their face Material   VIDEO WALKTHROUGHS  for every single problem on the homework or assessment  Alvin made videos walking through each one  I now have access to those walkthroughs for life on Github  If you are new to coding  these walkthroughs are your lifeblood  You can easily learn everything you need to know without stepping foot in a classroom if you have a good walkthrough for a problem set  These walkthroughs are thorough  and I used them for interview prep extensively  Competition  I was lucky un lucky  enough to have some extra cash to spend to seal the deal on nailing the technical interviews  I decided to enroll in Hack Reactor s prep course  I chose the premium prep option in which I was given a mentor who would design a curriculum based on my level of knowledge  I really just wanted technical interview questions so I could review them with my mentor  When I signed up  I knew fairly quickly this wasn t going to be App Academy  In order to get answers to questions as a premium prepper  I had to submit it in a certain format on a certain site  etc  When you have a question to a problem  the last thing you want is to have to go through the process of submitting it for review  and waiting 24 48 hours  The course itself was actually free  so i actually only paid for the submission of the code My mentor  who was already uncomfortable with me just wanting to do the technical interview prep  wanted me initially to start off at ground 0 learning what a variable was  After a prickly conversation  I moved on to a video session with him  Very knowledgeable guy  I just probably wouldn t put him as the mentor to receive people at first  I asked for a refund  and received one very quickly from the very nice people there  I think Hack Reactor is a strong tiered school  but their bootcamp prep approach differs from App Academy  I can promise you  as a ground 0 student  pay the extra money and go to a A  This is not the only experience  My business partner left his job at the same time as I did  and enrolled in Galvanize Bootcamp Prep  Galvanize has a course in which they don t even give you solutions to problems  He quickly had to leave because there were no problem reviews  and the instructor had never done the problems himself  I kid you not  he refused to answer how to do an isEven function  and instead said to  think about how to do it  You will never pass a technical interview with not repeatedly doing problems Conclusion   I can t speak to full bootcamps  the other camps I mentioned have extremely strong track records of success at their full camps  and I would be lucky to get into their immersive programs  That being said  no one has put more effort into their prep than Bootcamp Prep at a A

had no CS or SWE friends  but I followed my instincts and decided to apply to App Academy  For the interview process  I checked out the resources provided by App Academy to prepare for the coding challenges and found them helpful for getting a good start  I went through every possible interview round there was  first it was a timed coding challenge which I passed  but decided to attend their Jumpstart program where you have the chance to be accepted straight into the program if you pass their assessments  Which I highly encourage if you can make it out to SF for two weeks   just email them for more information about it  Unfortunately  I didn t pass Jumpstart  so I returned to SoCal and continued with my interview process  I went through a live coding test  a homework assignment  a timed test  another live coding test  and then finally making it to the behavioral interview before receiving the acceptance email Program  If you are thinking about doing a career shift and have zero coding experience  know that it s possible but you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the material and not fall behind  App Academy will be difficult  They move at a really fast pace and it

eligible for Software Developer jobs in the span of three months  There are some caveats though  I ll address the negatives of the program   before I delve into why I think it is a fantastic program that everyone should consider  The a A lifestyle is not for everyone  Whether you are invited to Jumpstart  or make it through to receiving an offer  it becomes quite apparent that a A does its best to recruit the best  brightest  and youngest to their program  Completing this program fortified my passion for coding  If you can t picture yourself coding from 9am 6pm  with a lovely 75 minute lunch  and then doing homework until 10 or 11PM every night  then you may want to reconsider  The material itself is not super  super dense  there s just an absolute ton that they shove at you in 8 weeks  In essence  be ready for your lifestyle to be a A all the time  Myself  and a lot of my cohort mates would take Saturday off and play basketball Sunday mornings   so I want to be transparent when I say that although it consumes your entire life  there are patches of time to catch your breath  The range of students also varies considerably  but by the end of the program everyone is committed to finishing together  One fact that I heard a lot  yet still surprised me was how diverse the cohorts are  Keep in mind software engineering is some really hard stuff  Learning Javascript in one week is not for the weak  so it makes sense that a majority of attendees come from prestigious schools  If that makes you wary  don t be  We had students with backgrounds from MIT  Standford  Princeton  dozens of mechanical and electrical engineers  former employees at firms such as Google  Goldman Sachs  Mckinsey  But we also had multiple people who failed college  only attended community college  had never held a job more than 25k  I think youre starting to get the picture  The people that have a limited background in tech engineering coding do typically do better but that s true with most endeavors in life so I hope that doesn t deter anyone reading this  What s vitally more important is being flexible and having a lot of drive  There s not a person above 30 in our group  and it makes sense given that a lot of us dropped everything to come to a city with the highest rents in the country and a full time curriculum to learn in a matter of months  It s overwhelming  and they specifically design it that way  Again  I want to repeat that because people will bash a A for stopping to help them when they re struggling  or going too quickly through the material  but they design the course to make it feel like you re always inches away from drowning  They don t have time to make it easy because you re competing with unemployed young guns with a fancy CS degree and boatload of knowledge Their contract sounds strict  but when it comes down to it they really want to help you find a job  If they had any loop holes they d be exposed and taken advantage of  You can t offer someone a free curriculum without being sure that they will do everything they can to go out and get that job upon completion  Again  you have to be ready to work and that is even truer during the job search curriculum  It s also worth mentioning  because people read too many marketing materials and get a ridiculous thought in their heads  that they will make 100k in 12 weeks  There are probably 2 5 people in our graduating cohort  out of 70  that could obtain that  The majority of graduates take 90 days to find a job so take that into account as you re doing your preparation  A few parts of my

I m thankful for spending my time there  I spent time with one of their tutors  that was extremely helpful  reviewing the problems that I struggled to break down into bite sized chunks  I recommend their services if you have the expendable cash  though it would be a LOT cheaper to find   The instructors were supportive but I think it was painfully obvious they were coders teaching  and not teachers coding  I have mostly great things to say about their individual styles to teaching  However  their structure seems a bit hap hazard and thrown together  I would venture a guess that they have filled in most of the curriculum on the fly   and if not  I suggest they take a step back and get organized  I know pair programming is a large part of the coding puzzle  yet this program is extremely individualized in a polarizing way  I had expected to be encouraged to work alongside one another  review code together  etc  Nada  If anything  I feel we were discouraged from doing so  I m

teach students the necessary skills to be a data science professional  Their technical coursework is supplemented by additional career and technical resources  including regular call opportunities with an industry expert to assist you in your projects and a career coaching team ready to help you dress up your resume and experience and tackle your job hunt  However  because there are no deadlines in this course  except for the 6 mo Course End date  you really have to stay on top of yourself  There are no mechanisms built into the coursework for advisors or mentors to track your progress and help push you along  if needed  so you  like I  may find yourself getting behind on the material and ending up at risk of not completing by Course End and losing access to the course without certification  But  if you are good at pacing yourself and staying committed over a long timeline  you will find Springboard is quite accommodating and flexible  They boast a  mentorship  program  with weekly 1 1 calls with an industry expert that I found to more closely resembles a one way  human Google  relationship than a proper mentor relationship  The burden of creating value from the calls falls entirely on the student and the  mentor  does not bring anything to the table  While they do a very good job of providing feedback and advise on specific questions and topics  when prompted  I feel like their mentor program could be so much better if the  mentors  actually mentored the students actively  That said  they cultivate a nice community amongst the students via their

 as I finally started getting responses from employers  On one of the applications I was one step away from employment  This course helps boost your chances and   compete with those who has formal specialized education  such as in computer science or data science  While a lack of formal experience through employment is still a problem  it is somewhat alleviated by the hands on curriculum projects and the projects done after completing the course  In my feeling  completing this course gives you a credibility  There are three main components  career coaching by people experienced in technical recruiting  mentorship by data scientists working in industry  and well organized tutorial materials  In my opinion  it would be very hard for a self learner to achieve such pace and quality of learning  Having to pay disciplines and ensures a good pace of learning  Not everyone gets a good mentor  My two advices here are  1  change the mentor if he behaves like he is your boss and only demands  and you need to spend a lot of time just to think what questions are good and bad  This could be OK only in the beginning  2  Stick to the one who is genuinely willing to help  Springboard allows to switch to another mentor  they have some long term selection in place  Most career coaches are very helpful  you can meet with them roughly every week  Here my suggestion is to stay organized  write their suggestions and execute on the same day  because otherwise you will find it difficult to get back to it due to a lot of main technical learning which keeps piling up if you are not as organized  Make sure to agree with your family members  they will miss you a lot 6 to 9 months  because they will mostly see your back while you are sitting at the computer  The skills you get are worth it  but there is still a long job search ahead after graduation in most cases  Delve deeply into material  as there are four mock up interviews close to the end of the course  The best ways to prepare for Data Science course is to learn Python  Statistics  and SQL in advance  and try to craft a resume and LinkedIn profile  At the end  you learn how to extend your network  data analysis  and machine learning  Only basic familiarity with statistics and SQL  but there are many resources in the curriculum  which you can use for training  including after graduation  No exposure to cloud techniques  but you will become prepared to play with those on your own  Up to two breaks are allowed  up to 3 weeks each  which helps make it in time if you like to delve deeper or have a lack of

is great because you know after the course completion where to continue your learning and find resources related to a specific subject  Every unit has a number of mini projects to practice that increase your confidence in your learning  1 to 1 mentor calls every week is a great benefit  as you will be interacting with an industry expert to review your projects and they will help you to streamline your learning and choose a better career path  At the end of the course  you will be proficient in python programming  mastered in essential statistical concepts and you can independently

background  I m a former teacher of 11 years  hoping to make a career transition in data science analytics  I just recently completed Springboard s Data Science Career Track certification program  and here are my pros and cons  Pros     Being paired with an expert mentor for the entire duration of the course is incredibly helpful  My mentor pushed me to go deeper beyond the curriculum and helped my projects really shine    This is my preference  but I appreciate the self paced online nature of the program  as opposed to live lectures  There are numerous case studies throughout the program that give you a guided opportunity to practice what you just learned  which is really helpful    The two required capstone projects are great for your portfolio  and really help you see the data science life cycle from end to end  Cons    The statistics curriculum is really lacking  Having no background in statistics  I found it hard to keep up with as they covered difficult topics superficially with speed  Part of the statistics curriculum is reading a book called  The Art of Statistics  Unless you have prior background in statistics  this book is not easy to understand    The program does its best to cover many common machine learning algorithms  but they don t really go into detail on how the algorithms work  You ll watch some pre recorded online lectures from Harvard  but it s hard to learn from a one off lecture without really building the fundamentals of how basic algorithms work  I am just beginning my job search  so I cannot speak to the quality of the job support  From what I understand  you meet with a career coach biweekly to help you with your job search  To qualify for the job guarantee  you need to apply to 4 jobs per week and make 7 networking connections per week and do 2 informational interviews per month  They definitely emphasize networking as the main way to get your first job  as opposed to cold applications  All in all  I definitely learned a lot from this program  If you are an independent learner and are OK with taking additional courses on statistics and ML after completion  I would definitely recommend this

mentor experience and career services are absolutely top notch for Springboard  My wife had a baby in the middle of my cohort  and Springboard allowed my to pause for a very generous amount of time

Engineering and 2 years of experience working as an engineer  I pursued this course full time  working approximately 30 50 hours a week towards it  I was able to complete the course with Advanced ML Specialization in 5 months   I now have a job as a Machine Learning Engineer  with a base salary that is 23  higher than my previous salary  I believe that this course is great for people who have a STEM degree and who have some technical work experience or technical project experience  If you do not have these things  I think it would be wiser to either pursue a technical degree or one of Springboard s other courses  such as their DA or DE courses  I rate the coursework three out of five stars  The structure of the coursework was immensely helpful in guiding my journey to learn the steps in the DS ML workflow  and it kept me organized and disciplined in my studies  The early course material does a good job of explaining the basics of Python  SQL  and the DS workflow  However  the depth of the course material starts to lose its quality in the sections covering statistics  ML algorithms  and the specialization material  There are mini projects related to the major algorithms  regression  classification  and clustering  and statistical concepts  CLT  AB tests  etc  however  these sections sometimes skip over critical details that are commonly discussed in technical interviews  such as assumptions of linear regression  Additionally  the ML specialization did not provide projects related to the topics of deployment  Overall I would have liked to see more depth and detail in the later content  I will add that most of the content is either coursework on DataCamp or proprietary Jupyter Notebooks created by Springboard  Many of my peers agreed that the DataCamp coursework does not retain well since they are simple fill in the blank exercises  The notebooks are more useful since they show practical examples of how an algorithm or concept would be applied  but overall the content has a perceived low value since the DataCamp membership can be had for a low price  The mentorship was also hit or miss  I was lucky to have a mentor with a background in statistics  so he was able to explain some of the advanced concepts that I really needed help with understanding  Some of my peers had mentors with backgrounds in MLE or analytics  and they were not of much use to my peers  Therefore I would say that the value of the mentor is dependent on luck  I believe that the true value of the course comes in career support  portfolio projects  and the alumni network  Springboard actually does a great job of aggregating good articles for how to pursue a career in DS  how to tailor your resume  and how to network  The career coaches are very experienced in recruiting and HR practices  so they give great advice when it comes to resume design and how to approach interviews  The course also includes mock interviews for behavioral  coding  project presentation  and general DS interviews  which are invaluable in preparing for real interviews  The portfolio projects are vital when it comes to catching the eyes of hiring managers  so I would recommend tailoring those to the companies you want to work for  Most of all  I found value in the alumni network  I was able to secure a couple of interviews easily because I reached out to Springboard alumni at companies that were hiring  I would recommend Springboard to anyone who is looking to change careers  but I would only recommend this DS course for individuals who have a technical background since companies typically look for some form of technical background for this type of role  As mentioned previously  I would recommend individuals with little to no background to pursue another path with a lower barrier to entry  such as Data Analytics or Data Engineering'),(495,3,16,'Matthew

GPA  28 years old at the time  No internships  relevant work or volunteer experience in the tech field  In fact  my general work experience was 3 years at   Mcdonalds  then 7 at a Resort as a bartender   Spent 30 50 hours a week studying  10 20 hours a week working on my resume  cover letter  connections  and job searching   Got a job offer and accepted an entry level Data Scientist position at about 4 5 months into the program  Currently still in after 3 months  love it  Pros   Springboard itself is great and has a lot of the materials needed to learn the basics of DS  The reading videos coding can be tiresome at time  but just take it one step at a time and you ll near the end eventually  Take good notes and read every single line  do as much as the coding as you can but don t spend too much time on it  spend more time on your capstones as these are what will probably make or break your chances of landing a DS position  Make a daily weekly schedule to make sure you complete the program on time  I recommend 5 7  completion every week  at least for the first couple of months  It will get harder as you go and you will suffer burnout too  But if you could accomplish more early on when you re still full of energy  then you ll have some room to slow down or take a break later on in the course if needed   Mentors are smart and always there if you need something  Career coaches are great  I recommend getting to know them early on as I feel like besides learning the DS skills itself  this part of the program was the most beneficial  Unfortunately  if you re like me with a not so pretty background  the coaches might hit you with some reality that you will most likely become a Data Analyst first before ever becoming a DS  But if you run into one that truly cares  they can help you out so much  I attribute my current DS position to my career coach s help  So while all the career coaches are great and helpful  if you can find one where you see that they truly care about you and your job search  I recommend making a connection with that person and making as much calls to them as possible   Cost is relatively doable for the bootcamps I ve looked at so far  The payment options are nice as well  Customer service is excellent and quick to answer any questions Cons  Not sure if this is a true con  but many of study materials are free or attainable with a subscription fee  But that can be said about most schools too so  What s great is the structure and how one can learn the materials through repetition even though the beginning may be quite confusing   Signed up for DS career track  but was told by many  except one  that I will most likely land a DA role before getting a DS position  Although that one person did help me beat the odds and get a DS position even though I ve no true experience  But this is rare apparently  and requires dedication   There s not too much cons about Springboard itself  Overall  if you stick to

terms of progressive difficulty and logical continuity  This to me  is so important for sustaining motivation to complete the program  2 It is highly hands on and project oriented  This is a good thing  always a good thing  and Springboard recognizes that  Almost every unit has at least one mini project to explore the content covered in that unit within an implementation context  You also need to complete two Capstone projects of your choice in any areas of your interest as part of the curriculum  and these projects are great for your Github or your resume  Clearly  Springboard appreciates that project oriented learning is essential to drive certain concepts home and again  sustain motivation by seeing the fruits of your labor  3 The quality of the resources  Data Science experts on the Springboard Team have put in efforts to create high quality resources   both technical and career oriented  These are usually well drafted informational documents or videos  They also handpick a good selection of public articles videos  and even one wonderful book  to supplement your learning  and their partnership with DataCamp  shoutout  gives you access to a rich library of also high quality content  4 Flexibility Look  Springboard gets that life happens  and they ve got your back  There is an option to take a 2 3 week pause from the course ANYTIME to perhaps catch up on other responsibilities or to maybe just  recharge  Also  they offer a free 2 month extension to finish the program if you don t finish within the original 6 months  which can also turn out to be quite a blessing  I m a full time CS student at UCLA  so when I ran into a difficult quarter  I could still manage because of their flexible options  5 Community You re assigned a Student Advisor and Mentor

burnout  and more  They really help keep you afloat during your journey  You meet with your mentor on a weekly basis so they can guide you with projects and difficult material  or tell you more about the industry and their type of work  which is always interesting to hear  My mentor was super helpful with his feedback on my projects and helped me shape them into something I was proud of  I should also mention that support on their Slack is pretty good too for Q A related things  their customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful  and their cohort of career coaches are also excellent  so be sure to make regular appointments with them because they give extremely valuable and insightful advice about the industry and building the professional profile you want for yourself  All in all

instructor to keep you accountable on a daily basis  it can be really easy to fall behind  Fortunately Springboard has a number of student advisors and other support staff who can help with setting a schedule for you to follow and giving you extensions  both of which I ve used  But I think the people who can best thrive in this kind of program are those who can set clear goals for themselves on a

right Data Science bootcamp  mentorship was the most important element to me  I needed to connect with someone who was able to help me master coding  thinking in data science  and the cutting edge innovations happening in the field   while bearing in mind my background in philosophy and interest in AI Ethics  Rigor in the field  plus a way to tie it to the mental model I already had about the world  I was lucky to have found a mentor  Ben  who did exactly that in my time at Springboard  Especially great  too  is their unlimited mentors option   a half hour day  every day  for the entire time you re part of the program  I used that liberally to cover the gaps  ask deeper questions  and find resources that were off curriculum  Springboard s curriculum is mostly public domain  and I appreciated most of the resources they provided  DataCamp isn t very helpful to learning to code  in the end  try learning French only by being given full sentences  with a single word missing in each sentence you have to fill in   not gonna happen  The notebooks they provided were mostly good  Sometimes they were unhelpful to learning this or that concept  although the team was rapid to help out  Here s my recommendation to Springboard  Give the option for students to do e g  four capstones after Unit 6  the guided capstone they have us do  rather than walk through the whole curriculum  If they opt to do four capstones  make the rest of the curriculum optional   they d simply be resources to help students out on their capstones  The capstones would then have to be approach specific  e g  do a capstone that works with a time series  or NLP  in order to get credit for the capstone  I suggest this because I find that I learned a LOT when I worked on my capstones  because they related to topics I cared about  and sincerely wanted to understand   more  in fact  than I ever did plodding through DataCamp or lectures that didn t necessarily interest me  I think that d also be better for student portfolios   it shows they re self motivated and can actively produce multiple projects on a diverse array of subjects problems within Data Science  Just my two cents  IMO it s an idea worth

Data Science Career Track of the Springboard program  I was recommended by one of my Ph D  student friends  who eventually successfully   landed a good working position  I therefore decided to follow his footsteps Overall  I am quite satisfied with Springboard s program  I think it has formed me well to become a data scientist and to quickly land a job  However  I believe there are a few things they can still improve on Pros  Overall Quality  the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world  used in the industry  It covers most aspects of data science  wrangling  visualization  ML      and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field  Of course  it won t replace extensive years of professional experience  but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career  Preparedness  I would argue that the data science track doesn t require advanced programming skills  but it is best to have some Python experience  the software overwhelmingly used in the course  If you don t  like me  the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve  You eventually pass that stage though  The Capstone Projects  the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish  A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt  which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor  These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers    Mentorship  Speaking of which  the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course  and why the price is a bit high  For those who need someone to look over their shoulder  it s definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course  The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard  bad experience with mentors is quite rare  Plus you can always change  if it gets really bad  Career  The career services they offer are equally useful  By helping you build your résumé  your LinkedIn profile  etc  Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers  The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations  Flexibility  While it is not something obvious when you start  you can actually ask for pauses  freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum  or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional   personal life  I assume they don t openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time  I personally extensively used those  mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph D  work  specially when it came down to my thesis defense  I eventually completed the program in 12 months  However  I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame  6 8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week  If you trail like I did  Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions Cons  Rates  their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it s mostly because of the number of resources they

has been the worst part of the whole program  I assume it s because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students  across all tracks  but their personnel s size hasn t keep up with the trend  While I always eventually obtained the information I requested  it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person  First of  they only allow email communications  Then  their services are split between advisors  support team  finance team  etc  So if you ask for something to someone  they will most likely re direct you to someone else  And the response time can be a few days  I don

far the biggest strength of Springboard  so big that others have copied it  My mentor was just the person I had craved for a long time in my educational career  smart  good people skills  and accountable  I learned as much from   him as I did in my Master s program  The 30 minutes a week were invaluable and gave me insights I would not have found on my own 	CurriculumFor the most part  the curriculum is very good  It s a combination of online resources Springboard doesn t create themselves  but if I had to learn data science all over again  I would rather learn from these resources than random Google searches  Save the Google searches for the projects  where most of the learning comes from anyway  The curriculum is also more up to date than an in person program  The projects stretched me to my limits  and I came out a much better data scientist because of it   	Course SupportThere has been an increase in course support over my time at Springboard  There is an option to have an additional mentorship meeting with a different mentor just to work on non Capstone projects  Springboard also hosts an annual conference at their headquarters that is worth attending if you are a student  My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it Negatives 	Job SupportSpringboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job  but it s close  You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards  I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance  but they seemed to have hired new staff  I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role  but it s an intense six months  Completion TimeI took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish  This was more a human error than a Springboard error  and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard  I could have easily finished in the allotted time  Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects  FeedbackOutside of my mentor  I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework  Overall  Great experience  would do again  The positives are fixable and far outweigh the negatives and I found it paid for itself in salary raises  even with the extensions  This is the direction education is going  and I look forward to watching what

free interactive courses  lectures  multiple assignments to submit and a great administrative staff  It is not only Python  but a some UNIX  some Git  some SQL  some pyspark   sort of everything you need to operate as a data scientist  This is a double edged sword because you learned how to do something  applied it for the next segment but would go a weeks without having practiced it  I spent a lot of time referring back which was frustrating  The most frustrating aspect is for most of the mini projects  the assignments would ask you to do either new concepts code or use functions methods attributes that were not emphasized in the interactive lessons  I again spent a lot of time referring back  combing through my notes  only to discover  it was not covered or not sufficiently  Perhaps  this would not be an issue if you had some previous skill with Python or a lower level language  My previous language was R The one thing that can make or break your experience is your assigned mentor

wrangling  statistics  data story telling and ML  It also lets you deep dive into each of these topics so that you can apply them in your 2 major capstone projects  There are also more than 10 mini

course  Things you should watch out for  The estimated time suggested by Springboard for each topic is kind of on the lower range so you need to keep that in mind to plan your studies  Also  a very important thing to consider is that this is a mentor based course where in you get a mentor assigned to you for the entire course time who guides you through your projects  My mentor was very helpful

support from mentors support team after your enrollment in any manner and course is not easy at all as they state you while enrolling Whenever you try to reach support team student adviser to discuss your concerns they don t pick your call many times and if they receive the call they just say will come back to you in few min EOD or will solve within EOD but you don t get any solutions on time or they try to convince you as per their needs whenever you try to raise your concerns regarding the course  you will get only one statement answer like you are not attending sessions properly  not following the mentor instructions or you are not spending your time  They will never ever agree their mistakes and listen you concerns as well Most pathetic part   When you say i am not satisfied with

Springboard s  customer support   very friendly and helpful  and career support  they get you started on job stuff early on in the program  A fair portion of the data science curriculum  so far  has consisted of Datacamp exercises  Springboard partners with Datacamp  and students get free access to Datacamp courses  Honestly  I haven t been that impressed with the Datacamp courses  They are helpful for gaining superficial exposure to tools and skills used in data science  but they don t cultivate a deep understanding  I will say that the time estimates Springboard gives  completion in 6 months  working 15 20 hrs a week  are pretty unrealistic  Most of my study group  including me  is working on the course full time  and we are all on track to finish in 5 months  at the earliest  and probably more like 6 months  Unless you already have significant data science experience  don t expect to finish the program in under 5 months  and possibly even under 6 months Overall  given my experience so far  I would probably recommend  pretty highly  Springboard s program to people  depending on their circumstances  I m happy to discuss my experience with people if anyone would like to

some lectures are from 4 5 years ago The main focus is the two capstones and the mentor interaction to keep you moving forward on them The Python datacamp courses  at the time  where mostly useful  though at some points I used other materials from courses like Udemy or LinkedIn Learning where the curriculum fell short of the coursework being asked The coursework at many points has incorrect time estimates for the  2 4 hrs suggested but actually needing 10 20  Some coursework questions and worksheets were out of date or missing  If you have a full time job then staying on a schedule based on the course completion time then you will be as frustrated with this as we were  The most common observation on the forums was the poorly supported statistics element  with insufficient course material

the end of the course  I was required to pass 4 mock interviews and complete two capstone projects which prepared me a lot for the job hunting  I landed interviews from many companies  from start up to large companies like Amazon  near the end of my study  Though  I have to say  the course alone won t be enough for interviews at the likes of Amazon and Google  it should be sufficient to help you

Graduated with a master s in one of the biosciences  few months prior to bootcamp  Due to my work  already had background in data analysis  stats  and programming   in another language besides Python  Some Python tutorials were sufficient for applying to this bootcamp  CURRICULUM  Covers required basics  esp for data science interviews  Mostly based on pre existing materials online  but Springboard does the legwork of sifting through the overwhelming sea of Internet resources and curating them into a chronological curriculum  Additionally  they ve got their own resources  including lists of interview questions and networking how to s  These were immensely helpful  I also used the interview questions as a study guide  which paid off as several topics appeared in actual interviews  STAFF MENTOR  Lots of support   you can schedule calls with a career coach  do mock interviews  and generally interact with other people in what could otherwise be an isolated journey of self teaching  Incredibly professional and knowledgeable staff  very responsive customer support  I was also very happy with my mentor  The first one I was assigned to was a bit lackluster  but after having to postpone my start date  I ended up with another one  My weekly call with him helped me stay on track  and he was incredibly helpful and encouraging  This included post bootcamp  when I sought his advice on choosing between jobs CAPSTONE PROJECTS  Critical part of my resume  since I didn t have industry experience or data sci projects where I used machine learning  Starting a project can be intimidating and unfamiliar  so the bootcamp provided me structure  Another Springboard staff member grades your project and provides feedback   I wish their comments suggestions were more detailed

plus lots of extra reading outside the curriculum  particularly practice tech  amp  behavioral questions  Also deployed one of my Springboard projects as a Flask web app  I went to events Meetups  did informational phone calls w  close and distant contacts  and applied to several jobs  requiring cover letters  each week  Overall  Good self paced curriculum that covers the basics  Pricey  YMMV  but

just a couple days ago  accepted a job offer as an Application Developer for a local financial services company  Here are the pros   and cons of my experience with Springboard   PROS  Colt Steele presents all the instruction materials  via recorded video  He does a great job and was super easy to follow along with  It was pretty rare that I would complete a video and not understand the concepts he had presented   I found the Career Services very impressive  The career coaches are really high caliber individuals in the field of job searching  recruiting  resume building  etc  Very  very helpful  They even made themselves available to me outside of the allotted career calls   The mentors are also a great resource  My mentor was very easy to get ahold of and a highly skilled programmer who was able to show me lots of little details that the curriculum would not have had the time to get into  He is actively involved in the industry right now so he is able to translate  classroom  material into how it works in the real world   Obviously I don t have experience with other bootcamps to compare  but I think the price of Springboard is very  very reasonable  The assignments  which may be the most important part of any program  were appropriately challenging  Most of them required going beyond what was explicitly taught in the lesson and forced you to go deeper  in a good way   CONS  In my humble opinion  I think the curriculum spends a little too much time on Object Oriented Programming  OOP  From what I understand  this model is beginning to be replaced by more functional programming  I also think React should be introduced much earlier  That seems to be the most prominent front end framework right now  so it would be beneficial to learn that sooner rather than  mastering  traditional vanilla JavaScript   There were times where the Springboard site was a little bit glitchy  but it was never so much of an issue that it prevented me from working for much time  Definitely not glitchy enough to be a major concern'),(764,3,22,'Jacob Kubek','False',2022,'False','2022-07-10','2022-07-10','5.0','5.0','5.0','5.0','Springboard was an

scheduled career development assignments  This ensures that your preparedness for seeking a job  getting doing interviews  and landing a first tech job progresses on a track that coincides with your technical skills development  The only possible con would be if you weren t looking for a job  If that is the case then the price is a bit steep for the technical skill development alone  But they

just about 6 months  which was a pace that worked me  That flexibility to continue working as much as you want was nice  The course covered many frontend  backend  and database technologies including

Engineering for better work life balance  among other things  I did Springboard from March 2020   May 2021  took multiple breaks  I started applying to jobs on May   30  2021 and only interviewed with 1 company  1 phone screen and 1 virtual onsite  and received accepted an offer yesterday  June 17  2021  as a Software Engineer I  What convinced me to choose Springboard  in order of importance to me  1  Flexibility   While I would rather go to an in person classroom style bootcamp  I didn t want to do those 3 month intensive bootcamps where I had no time for anything else  Springboard provides remote learning and therefore  this teaching model wasn t affected by COVID  I applied in Feb 2020 and started in March 2020  and even prepares you for a remote job afterward  if that s your goal  2  Instructor is good   If you want to see if you like his style  take Colt Steele s Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course or check out his Youtube channel  3  Job guarantee   if you don t get a job within 6 months  I think with COVID  it s now a year  of graduating the course  you get a full refund  Be aware there are still requirements to follow in order to qualify to get the refund  4  Accountability   weekly 1 1s with a paired mentor who is a professional in the industry 5  The topics the bootcamp covers are pretty extensive 6  Price   Given the amount of material  support  and timeframe  the price is way better than those 3 month intensive bootcamps  I chose the month to month payment plan  but if you can afford it  just pay upfront  After taking the course  here are my pros cons  Pros    Flexibility  see above    Accountability   I had a really great and supportive mentor throughout the entire course  However  you can switch mentors if you want    Multiple Break Options   Pause s Freeze for when life gets abnormally busy or you need a break from the course  Both options push your deadline date    2 Live Code Reviews with mentors who are not your regular mentor   Really supportive student advisers  who can be an extra accountability point   Semi weekly office hours  curriculum related and general questions for student advisers as well    recorded so you can reference whenever   There s a lot of material and you get so much practice with tons of projects and exercises with  further study  sections   10 assessments that are reviewed by your mentor   2 capstone projects   TAs are available via chat during normal business hours   Career office hours  go over topics related to resume  Linkedin  networking  etc    recorded so you can reference whenever   8 career coach calls check ins   Placements team to help send job opportunities to your inbox closer to when you are completing the course  I believe this team was created in 2021    They care a lot about their students   They ask for a lot of feedback from students and will make changes or improvements that make sense    Everyone is so nice and supportive Cons    Interview readiness  Interviewing was probably what I felt least prepared for at the end of the curriculum  If you are making the switch into software engineering  you need to know now that interviewing is a whole different ballgame than the actual job itself  Some software engineers go to interviewing bootcamps JUST to prepare for interviewing  It s one thing to know how to code and problem solve  but to also be able to talk through your thought process AND have your code work or have to figure out bugs in your code while someone is watching   interviewing can be really stressful  I was super lucky because I have a software engineer friend that practiced with me every night for 1 5 months to help me prep for the MOCK interviews  and I ended up still not passing my first attempt at the coding mock interview  I think I had been practicing with my friend for a month already at that point  In addition to practicing with my friend  I even scheduled 1 practice mock interview with Springboard before attempting and ultimately passing my second official coding mock interview  FYI if you don t pass within 2 tries  you no longer qualify for the job guarantee   so at the time  it felt like high stakes to me  However  this shouldn t have been the focus  see Tips below  I also understand that not everyone has a friend that they can practice with every night and get valuable feedback  yes  I know she s a very good friend  so I think Springboard needs more support in this area where students can choose to practice with a live person however many times they want  in advance  to prepare for the coding and white boarding mock interviews    Pretty new curriculum  including policies and procedures  At least at the time that I started  they were still figuring out kinks bugs in the curriculum so the exercises could change shortly after you do them  this happened to me  but there wouldn t be any notification about it  Now that they have hired more people  the communication is better about this sort of thing  While the changes can be annoying  this is also a good thing because that means they care about their curriculum and students and are always looking for ways to improve  They have also made a lot of updates and come out with new documentation around their policies and procedures  You as a student just need to go with the flow    Every time you have a question or have a bug that you can t figure out  uploading your code to Google Drive or GitHub and then having to type out your issues questions to the TA in a little chat box can be really annoying but this also gives you training on what it s like to work remotely   Although  I think in work settings  it s more likely that you would be able to have a quick meeting and share your screen  I know Springboard is trying to work on a solution to this  but this also isn t the end of the world  I can see that it s probably much easier to ask a question in person be in a class setting for when you do have questions    No new friends  at least for me  You don t really get to know your cohort that well unless you take initiative and be really social online   but to put it bluntly  I m older and I m not doing this to make friends haha  Everyone in my cohort online did seem really nice and I knew people in my cohort who made individual study groups or paired up  but this just wasn t my thing ONLY because I already had a friend who was taking the UI UX bootcamp with Springboard  she was probably ahead of me by 6 months  and we were each other s accountability buddies  and that was really helpful  Even after she graduated  we could keep each other accountable on her job search and my progress with Springboard  I understand that this is rare though so if you want to socialize and make study groups with your cohort  by all means  do that  Tips    I m not sure if this is still the case  but when I enrolled they let us access the curriculum 2 weeks before our cohort start date  and the deadline to decide if you want a refund is 2 weeks after the cohort start date  This is basically 1 full month where you get access to the curriculum to try it out  If you re on the fence about choosing Springboard and you re not in a rush to do the bootcamp  enroll in a cohort date late enough so that you get this 1 month trial    Keep in mind that the point is to NOT get a refund  the point is to get a job with your new awesome skills    With self pacing learning  it s important to stay disciplined but stay healthy  Stick to a schedule  Turn off distractions  Make sure to eat well  drink water  exercise  and get plenty of sleep  You can t perform your best if your health goes down the drain  This is for your mental health too    Take breaks if you need them    If you don t think the weekly 1 1 mentor calls are enough  get an accountability buddy   could be from your cohort or could be a friend    Reach out to your student advisor because they are super helpful and can keep you accountable too    Career changes are DIFFICULT  Find your  why  and remind yourself of it when you re feeling unmotivated  Or better yet  look at it every day or week    Do your best  Don t give up  Keep a positive attitude

knows how to break things down and explain them in a logical  and humorous  way  Springboard did a very good job matching me with my mentor  I was really able to connect with him and looked forward to our weekly meetings Overall  my experience was an A  and I would recommend Springboard to anyone'),(829,3,22,'Anonymous','True',2020,'True','2020-08-24','2020-08-24','2.0','2.0','2.0','2.0','I have been enrolled at Springboard since April of 2020  I took their Software Engineering Career Track Prep course in order to get a strong basis for the main course  This course had a lot of good coverage on introductory subjects like standard CSS   Javascript  and HTML  I have taken a number of college courses on these subjects beforehand and didn t struggle with the prep material at all  I also really enjoyed the teacher  Colt Steele  You can Google his name and get a nice summary of his accomplishments with Rithm School  in person Bootcamp in San Francisco  My issues with the program started around Section 12 13  While the earlier sections are easy enough to understand  that almost everyone won t struggle with them  once you get into more complex topics the issues with Springboard become more glaring  Colt does a great job at breaking down subjects in the videos and keeps things interesting with fun jokes and a lighthearted approach to learning Web Development  The real issues seem to be with the supporting material and structure that Springboard itself provides  You meet with a  mentor  once a week for 30 minutes where you can t really accomplish all that much besides discuss a few issues you are currently having with your code  I actually like my mentor a lot  but they aren t supposed to be there to support you constantly as you work through the various projects assignments  Instead  you are asked to reach out to the TA s  which Springboard states are available via chat and email throughout the day  This is a lie  There are really only 1 2 actual TA s that respond via email and on my experience the chat option is really only available around 5  of the time  So after you type up the issue you are experiencing  you just wait for a response  whether you needed a quick 5 word reply on something  or an extremely complex explanation with multiple paragraphs  it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours to get a response  There are no 1 on 1 virtual sessions where a TA would join a Zoom call and work with you individually to track down issues  Instead you upload code to Google Drive and wait for them to download and par ruse your uploaded code  Also the sections are setup in a really weird fashion  You are expected to watch 10  videos all at once per section  each ranging from 5 20 minutes  and then work through exercises at the end  which could cover something you learned in the second video over 2 hours previously  Instead of re enforcing important subjects along the way  and no  coding along with Colt does not count as exercises Springboard     It ends up being extremely hard for individuals to have a feeling of cohesiveness between the instructional videos and actual assignments  It comes across as lazy and unconventional for a school you are spending  8 000 12 000 to attend  My wife attended Flatiron and I recommend that bootcamp far above Springboard  as far as web development is concerned  I know they are solid on the data science front from what I have read  Pros Colt Steele is a really good teacher  but can move a bit fast for some I imagine   Material is presented with very modern tools  frameworks  and methodologies   Fully online so you can  do it from anywhere   Online Slack community of other students  though it isn t very active  Cons   Extreme lack of assistance when working on larger projects assessments  Just wait till you get to the Hack and Snooze app oof   TA s are basically non existent   Office hours are usually clogged with 20 30 students that are all working on completely different parts of the curriculum and getting questions in for your specific needs is near impossible   Coding along with Colt during lessons is not good enough for reinforcement of complex topics   Career Prep is essentially updating LinkedIn  Attending virtual events  and updating your resume   No Pair Programming    Springboard just telling you to  check the solution  for answers  Giving me the answers  and helping me understand concepts are not the same thing   Doesn t require enough GIT push pulls to make your profile look more active to employers   Basically completely self driven  which I know works for others  but not for me as I really enjoy structure   Changed their  job guarantee  mid curriculum  Very little feedback from the maintainers of the curriculum as to why they are choosing to do certain things over others  If you are searching for an fully online Software Development  I sincerely recommend looking elsewhere  Flatiron is the only other school I can speak on personally as my wife attended  I have worked in a separate section of Information Technology for nearly a decade and I struggled a lot to use their learning materials  And for perspective  I have 4 year IT degree  and 10  IT Certifications in infrastructure  TLDR Steer clear of Springboard unless it is for their Data Science Career Track  Their Software Engineering course is very new and needs a lot of work with supplemental activities to bring it up to par with both their other offerings  and other offerings available at other

nothing but supportive and encouraging throughout  I have heard of other students with mentors that they didn t have a great experience   with  However  Springboard has a VERY responsive support team  and I m sure they d be quick to act on that if it s ever brought up  They are very friendly and accommodating  Mentor meetings occur once a week  and my mentor gave me feedback on my four projects  job advice  my portfolio  and more  I honestly don t know where I d be without a mentor  In addition  we had career coach calls with recruiters in the tech industry that were really educational as well  I feel more of these could have been beneficial for us  but I also haven t experienced any of the post completion coach calls  which are every two weeks to report how the job search and networking is going  and to get tips feedback  It seems like the program genuinely cares about us even post certification  rather than just sending us off in the discouraging at times job search  I haven t experienced the job guarantee  rules  yet  but there are a few parameters  which seem reasonable to me  to follow in order for the job guarantee to apply  I also really benefitted from the mock interviews  I feel I got a good general idea of what to expect  They were realistic and I genuinely can t imagine finishing a UX bootcamp without knowing how the interviews run  including whiteboard challenges  Finding a program that was self paced was important to me for two reasons  the first being that I was in a different timezone  so online live classes to attend was not realistic for me  Second  I found other bootcamps that were just 4 months  While that may be advantageous for those who are rushing to get a job  I didn t want to rush my projects and portfolio creation  Since this was my first time learning about UX  I wanted to soak all the learning in without rushing too much  And I m so glad I did  It s a lot harder than people think to discipline yourself to complete the course with a goal in mind  eg  I wanted to finish in 6 months  as I didn t have a full time job and could devote all my time to the course  but instead it took   12 months  Another plus was that articles we had to read were mostly written by professionals in the field AND written with personality  vs a textbook reading  It made learning much more enjoyable and kept us in the current trends of

going through the technical material  This early prompting to start thinking about how you are going to get a job and slowly building skills necessary for this were extremely helpful for me  You come out of the course with an updated UX UI resume as well as a updated and revised  by career coach  Linkedin  You are assigned a student advisor which helps you keep moving along  Having someone to keep

was able to land a job in my field of choice before I completed the program   I didn t have much hands on time with career services  but following the career segments in the curriculum proved to   be worthwhile  The Pros  When I enrolled at Springboard I didn t have any prior experience with UX UI design  Springboard has certainly built a great curriculum that gave me very solid foundational skills and a fundamental understanding of the industry  Springboard showered me with plenty of amazing resources that I continue to use even after graduating  I had to get very good at organizing my bookmarks  By far THE BEST part about Springboard is the 1 on 1 mentoring  I had weekly calls with my mentor who demonstrated a high level of industry knowledge  and was able to give excellent feedback and insight to my projects and questions  Over the course of 9 months you re able to develop a relationship with your mentor  and add them to you network of professionals  To me this is where Springboard shined  The cons  kind of  That being said I m not sure bootcamps are for everybody  I already came into the UX UI Design Career Track as a self taught front end developer and my web development skills played a crucial role in landing my position  You need to be a certain type of person to succeed in a boot camp  I consistently went above and beyond for my Capstone projects  and Portfolio  I would study design disciplines outside of what was offered in the normal curriculum as well  If you re an ambitious self self starter then these bootcamps really can propel you into your next career  However if you tend to take a passive approach to your learning then look elsewhere'),(935,3,25,'Valerie

Springboard and it was personally a really great fit for me  Overall  This program was a lot of work  I thought I would finish well before the nine months I did not  Realistically  I had a full time job and was taking this course   and I would say that their suggestion of nine months is very accurate  It also allows you time to circle back to old projects and improve them and really let your brain be the awesome sponge it is and absorb all it can  I got real feedback on my projects from hiring managers  career coaches  and my mentor  all of which were actually rigorous and making sure your work is up to standard  As the title says  If you stick with Springboard and really actively try to improve your skills  I got a job before I even finished the program with my new skills  and a good one at that  Pros    My mentor was my absolute lifeline and made the program feel  real  which for me  as someone who avoids social activity at all cost  was huge because I had to talk to her weekly making sure I had something I could bring to her to talk about every week  Basically  I m the kind of person who goes  all in  on something for like two months and then forgets about it and drops it  my mentor was the core component of that not happening    The support system is great   Sometimes I think things like career coaches  mentors  etc  are overrated  but I was surprised at how much value I actually got from these mandatory meetings I would have otherwise passed on  Room for improvement    My IDP  real job experience  wasn t great  but Springboard staff was extremely helpful in navigating the situation  I would say my IDP experience was more or less a rare experience and other Springboard students seem to have had a great one  I wouldn t really expect to get a job from the IDP if you had any hopes in that  However  the career coaches at the end of the program will be very helpful to you in finding a job so no worries there  I would say  even if you don t have the best IDP experience  it s still job experience to put on your resume which is huge    Its very easy to just say you completed the reading by checking the box without actually doing it  I would love to see some sort of short quiz that verifies you went over the material incorporated into the program even if it isn t graded  just some sort of feedback to myself that I should go back and read more carefully  In Summary  I ve talked to other people from other bootcamp programs who don t have nearly as good outcome as springboard  A lot of them are six months out still looking for jobs and  with peace and love  don t have nearly as solid case studies  in some cases these programs don t even make you do case studies which are ESSENTIAL in landing a job   as Springboard

accommodate varying work life situations and always being willing to help out  The curriculum was engaging and Springboard does a great job overall of making students   feel like they ve grasped the material and have people to reach out to for support if needed  They also make sure you have the appropriate job materials in place  LinkedIn  resume  elevator pitch  web portfolio  and have had a chance to practice mock interviews to prepare you for your job search  What I would offer for improvement would be the portrayal of the job guarantee  I think it would be great if Springboard was more directly involved in connecting students with internships  relevant resources  or even potential employers based on their background  interests  and demonstrated success while working through the curriculum  The IDP project is not quite an internship  At first  this is what I thought was meant by job guarantee but I realized when attending the coaching calls that the student is expected to build a network on their own and try to find people who will be willing to do informational interviews with them and then try to leverage those connections  This is fine  but a bit different from what I thought would be provided and I think that if Springboard was more proactively involved in helping students connect with relevant people or resources that could turn into opportunities this would make their program even stronger and the job guarantee more compelling'),(942,3,25,'Rachel Meuler','False',2021,'False','2021-09-13','2021-09-13','4.0','4.0','4.0','4.0','After doing a ton of research on UX bootcamps  I chose Springboard because it met the most criteria  Overall  I am happy with the education I got from this program  However  I was fortunate to be involved with 2 study groups of great individuals  one   I was invited to  one I started  that met weekly for 1 hour on skype and were great about sharing resources  I also had a good mentor that I got along well with  and began meeting with career coaches early and often  Pros of this program    The curriculum is well structured and covers a wide expanse of UX methodology   The program is set up to give you some breathing room   although it is structured for 9 months  it actually allows for almost 12 months to complete   The mentoring and career coaching pieces are really valuable  and each student will have a unique mentor along with access to unlimited mentors   Your student advisor will support and advocate for you   I feel very confident in what I have learned and have gotten confirmation that I m adding value to the company I m working for now   You will get out of this program what you are willing to put in   if you are smart and strategic about the methods you use and the work you make  it will work for you Cons of this program    The impetus is totally on the student to be responsible for their own learning   if you are someone that needs a teacher to walk you through new ideas  tools  and techniques  this is not the program for you   The estimated 17 hrs work week is unrealistic if you are working full time  have a family  or other life obligations beyond this program  The program does work with you so you can complete  but it probably won t be in 9 months  think about this with your payment structure    There are some poorly structured deliverables that definitely feel like working harder  not smarter  Look ahead at the curriculum  especially once you start putting together your case studies  and build toward your portfolio  not google documents    Some of the resources are outdated   It can be difficult to find any available times to schedule meetings with career coaches and or unlimited mentors Springboard isn t perfect   nothing is  However  though there is room for

Springboard  It was a different experience for me to attend online courses  rather than in person  but a good and necessary one especially for these times of the pandemic  I like the self paced learning that it has because   there are times that life get s busy  This really helped me to just dial in what I was learning  If I wanted to spend more time in one subunit  I could and if I wanted to breeze through it  I could as well  The only con to this is that you get 9 months to finish the course  though that is a lot of time to finish the course  it does take away from the statement at your own pace because you have to finish in 9 months  My suggestion is to follow their schedule guide of how long you should spend in a subunit and keep to it  Some suggestions are longer than others and that is good  because if you finish a subunit early  then that just means you have more time to finish the other ones that take longer  Another suggestion I have is to look ahead at what you will be working on  both for Springboard and in your own personal schedule  When you get a bigger picture of what you have to do  you can easily manage your time accordingly  I like the mentor lead aspect of Springboard  It s good to get feedback from a professional and very helpful when you get stuck in certain areas of the course  My mentor helped me gain a better perspective of visual hierarchy and made me a better UI UX designer  The downside to this is that you have one meeting a week with your mentor to check in with you which is a 30 minute call  So you ll need to know exactly what you want to talk about in those sessions  Also  Springboard gives you unlimited scheduled calling with your mentor  but it s scheduled and sometimes you need answers to questions you have at the moment  To get around this  you can simply email your mentor and they usually respond within a day or two  Another great aspect is the coaching calls  You ll get the first hand experience with real hiring managers in the field  My coaches have helped me look at their perspective of what they would look for in a UX UI Designer and what pitfalls to avoid  Through the mock interviews  they have given me great feedback that will help me in interviews and with their keen eyes  they have helped me craft both a great resume and portfolio  I love Springboard and all that it has done for me  I am thankful to be

portfolio  The curriculum is compiled of articles created by Springboard and curated from around the internet  as well as exercises that build into capstones that can be utilized as portfolio projects  There are weekly calls with an industry professional mentor that help keep you on track and guide your learning  Additionally  there are periodic coaching calls to make sure your resume  portfolio  and social media are coming along with your course progress  This turned out to be a huge advantage as I had all the pieces to begin job hunting once I graduated  The mandatory mock interviews at the end of the course helped build my confidence and prepare me for the interview process  including salary negotiation  portfolio presentation  and whiteboard challenges  all of which I utilized in finalizing my offer  My experience with their customer service and student advising was always pleasant and prompt  One thing that really helped me get my offer was the IDP  Industry Design Project  where students are paired with a start up and get the chance to work on real life UX problems  From what I heard  this experience can vary depending on the company and team you are assigned to  for me it was monumental in gaining the necessary experience and having client facing talking points during interviews  As previously mentioned  the self paced model is not for everyone  and if you were to

complete the course to be far from reality  I was told it would take 9 months at 3hrs day of school work  However it took me close to a year at around 5 8 hours day to complete all of the assignments  I think the timeline to complete the curriculum is dependent on several factors  including your mentor s dedication to your learning  the complexity of capstone projects you choose and your experience with design when entering into the program  In retrospect I would suggest anyone considering this course to expect to spend at least twice as much time getting through it  Additionally  it helps to have a base knowledge or working experience with design when starting the curriculum  though it s not necessary  it ll save you a lot of time  Lastly  the mentor you re paired with is crucial to your success  I was lucky that my mentor was willing to go above and beyond our weekly 30min call times  If it wasn t for my mentor taking more of a teaching role I would not have been as successful or

Understand that any bootcamp is creating a foundation of skills  It s really a taster of the field  The bootcamp a great sandbox environment to learn  play  and and test things out in a safe  supportive environment  Pros Curriculum is excellent Numerous touchpoints throughout the bootcamp   Student Advisor  Dedicated Mentor who guides you through the program  Office hours with a Springboard person  Great Slack network  Mentor on Demand   multiple people  Career Counseling  Several mock interviews both technical and behavioral You are then a part of a really big network full of interesting people who have all kinds of backgrounds  You get a lot of exposure  guidance  and help for troubleshooting  I took the online self paced full time version  I happened to get a job within the first 8 weeks of the program and took a 4 month pause to onboard to that role and then complete the rest of the bootcamp for the final two months  Everyone was very supportive  patient  and really helped with managing stress  burnout  and motivation  It s really nice to be learning the material in a safe  supportive environment and know that everyone is interested and vested in your success  The curriculum is comprehensive and the resources shared are amazing  Before enrolling in Springboard s program  I tried to create my own bootcamp but it turns out that it is very difficult to find appropriate data when you yourself are outside of a business context  meaning  a lot of data is proprietary  I learned a little bit on my own but the structure and progression of the program is really worth the price tag  It really is an investment and opens your world up to a lot of great networking opportunities and practice  For Tooling  the curriculum follows Excel  SQL  Tableau  and Python  You complete case studies and projects using these tools  Remember that it s the business problem that s driving the tool usage and not the other way around  Be agnostic to tools and solutions  but it s really about the business problem you re solving for  There is also the core skills associated with data analytics and that s the financial perspective  the economic perspective  and the statistical perspective  all underpinned by strategic frameworks  Springboard is like a compressed MBA in this way and jumpstarts your business understanding if you don t already have it  Remember

Heisig','False',2020,'False','2021-04-07','2021-04-07','4.7','5.0','4.0','5.0','I enrolled in Springboard s Data Analytics Career Track upon completing a two year contract with Teach For America  I always had an interest in data but never felt confident in acting on it until I had to figure out my next step after teaching  I studied   international relations and communication writing in my undergraduate career so had no formal quantitative experience upon applying  From the moment I applied to Springboard  everything was incredibly professional and straightforward  In fact  after submitting my application  a recruiter called me within 5 minutes to talk about my interest   completely opposite of another boot camp I was considering who didn t even contact me despite confirming an appointment  This quickness made me think they were desperate  but the recruiter wasn t pushy but friendly and even gave me an informal interview to make sure I was someone who really wanted to sign up  After that call  I was required to take a roughly one hour long quantitative aptitude test to further verify that data analytics was a path I could reasonably pursue  I mention this because I was worried that I would fall trap to simply enrolling into a program that took anyone and everyone who signed up  In truth  I m not sure if they decline students from enrolling either way  but I felt confident that this interview and assessment were evidence that they were at least slightly selective in their admissions process  Curriculum The curriculum is mostly a curation of online resources  These resources come from YouTube videos  articles  and other websites related to business and data analytics  A couple of units are specifically dedicated to business education like economics  financial analysis  statistics  accounting  and other business fundamentals  The cycle of the projects also follows that of a typical data analyst workflow  somewhat similar to the scientific method in crafting a hypothesis  gathering data  exploration  etc  I found these concepts helpful as I was someone who steered away from anything business related up to that point  I simply had no interest back then  Most of the projects simulate a real world project utilizing the things you learned earlier in the unit  These are not typically from online resources and are created by Springboard  Given that I don t have real world experience with these kinds of projects  it s hard for me to stack them up against practicality  but they tended to help structure my capstone projects which require you to make up your own project and find the data for it  so it was helpful in that regard  Otherwise  sometimes the projects were poorly worded and it could be slightly cumbersome in finding out exactly what you were supposed to do  But these were usually minor and you could always clarify with your mentor or other students about the assignments and get clarification  They also release new versions of the curriculum to improve a particular assignment  section  or even whole unit based on student feedback so they really try to be responsive to what s working and what s not for students  Towards the final stages of the curriculum  you re required to do a series of interviews that would mimic a real interview you would get  For example  you do a behavioral interview  a presentation interview in which you create a presentation from a project in the course and give that presentation as if you were  working  for the organization  and a technical interview in which they ask you questions about statistics  business  SQL  or whatever else might come up in a real technical interview  Your career coach helps you prepare for these  mostly the behavioral ones as they aren t data specialists themselves but you can also do preparation with your mentor to prepare for these  They are pass fail  You re given a couple of opportunities to pass it but if you fail too many times then you have to redo a couple of units I believe  At first  I found this kind of scary  but the pressure it adds to those interviews is really helpful in simulating what it will be like when you re doing real interviews  They tend to be anxiety inducing  you ll be nervous  and the stakes are higher  The fact that they try to build this pressure into these mock interviews was pretty cool now that I reflect on it  At the time I didn t think it was that cool  But if you re someone who struggles with interviews  these mock runs are helpful not only in getting practice but also feedback from those interviewers  They go into detail about how you could do better or other things to think about when you get to a real interview  Mentors and Community Each student is assigned a mentor who is a data analyst scientist in the field  You have weekly calls with them and they re mostly there to guide you through the curriculum but you can always talk to them about other things like job searching or how they use tools techniques in their own jobs  etc  at least my mentor was open to talking about whatever  I hadn t ever come across anyone who had a bad experience with their mentor  but it doesn t mean it doesn t exist  My mentor was incredibly relaxed  easy to talk to  and helpful when I needed help in the curriculum or needed encouragement on something I found difficult  One thing that made me like my mentor more was also his ability to sometimes question minor details in the curriculum  I appreciate someone who can point out weaknesses in something even though they re part of the organization itself  It let me know that this person I was assigned to by Springboard wasn t necessarily a 100  kool aid drinking member of the club  but an independent person who  though still agreed the curriculum was a good one  was capable of sometimes saying  well I m not sure I would do it that way but it s valid  Upon being accepted into the program  you are also invited to the Slack channel for your specific course  This is where you can communicate with other students in the course who are all at different stages of the curriculum  though you do have a channel for people who are in your specific cohort  There are also Springboard faculty in the channel as well  including a person who helped write the curriculum  They are really helpful in clarifying kinks in assignments or helping students who are having a difficult time on something  There are also various channels for different types of things like job searching  motivation  resources  recorded lectures  and all types of things  Throughout the curriculum  you also have career units in which you learn strategies about job searching  You re also allowed to choose a career coach  who appears to be contracted with Springboard  I could be wrong about this  to provide 30 minute coaching sessions  These range from resume critiques  to mock interviews  to general strategies  to sharing resources  and really anything that they feel would be helpful to you  You also aren t required to stick with one career coach  you can always select from a whole list of people at any point and they have descriptions of their background to give you a sense of what to expect  I stuck with the same one the entire time because I didn t feel the need to talk to a different coach  The Job Search The job search process was not a totally pleasant one  as anyone who has gone through it can attest  But my career coach and the Springboard community in Slack were really helpful  You could see where other people were struggling as well and my career coach would always give helpful suggestions or resources to help in my search  I applied to a little over 90 jobs and had 3 total interviews  Again  I don t have any kind of formal background in data  business  or STEM besides the Springboard certificate and some projects to showcase my aptitude  so I felt that that was a bit of a barrier for me  Despite this  I did get a job  A friend of my partner referred me to a role at her company which landed me the interview  My career coach did a mock interview with me  reviewed Google Docs that I drafted interview responses to  and answered any other questions I had during the process  I can honestly say my experience in the boot camp really gave me a leg up  They loved that I had that experience and projects to show for it  During the final round of interviews for this role  I had a technical assessment and didn t do too hot on it  but I was able to redeem myself by talking intelligently about my projects in the course  I think this made me come across as someone who understood general concepts and use cases for specific things and even if I lagged on the technical assessment  I was someone who could get better quickly  My title isn t  data analyst  but  marketing specialist  Much of the role is data related though and even though some of it isn t  it allows me to use skills that I ve built over the years in undergrad and as a teacher so I m not 100  shifted into a totally new technical profession  The other roles I interviewed for were pure data analyst jobs though  I made it to either the final or next to final rounds in those interviews and made some mistakes that I think cost me the job  You learn from these though  and your career coach will help you diagnose what happened and how you can do better the next time  I finished the course in mid November and just recently got a job offer on March 29  so a little over 4 months after completing the course  Another cool thing that Springboard offers is post completion assistance  You re allowed to meet with another mentor who can help you be accountable for keeping your skills alive and building more projects to showcase to prospective employers  You have access to this mentor until you get a job and can be really helpful when you complete the course and then start to find that your skills are slipping  A Potential Downside One potential downside to this track might be the curriculum  Though this downside is innate in the way the course is structured  It s set up as a part time  6 month learning experience  They want you to get familiar with a wide range of tools that you could potentially use in a data analyst job  mostly the more popular ones as there are TONS of tools that you could potentially use in the field  In this regard  there s more breadth than depth in the things you ll learn  They are still helpful  After a unit and a project  you can honestly say that you re proficient in that tool or concept  You ll also learn that each tool could be its own 6 month course  If you haven t used Microsoft Excel professionally before  or maybe you have  you find out that Excel is more powerful than what you were familiar with  This was the case for me anyway  I m not sure that any boot camp can really overcome this downside though when the curriculum itself is designed to be completed in a relatively short period of time  You might become interested in diving deeper into a tool after completing a unit on it  but have to move on to the next tool introduced in the next unit  This is just part of being in tech  I recommend seeking other online resources if you become really interested in getting better at a particular tool  However  I still believe  along with many other practitioners  that the curriculum is still helpful in allowing you to understand the essentials and then get a job with them  In Conclusion I think the number one thing that you get out of the course is structure and community  Of course  you could learn everything in any boot camp online for free  but you to be someone who can muster the discipline and structure to stick to it long term  I have a habit of constantly looking for new resources to learn from  even after finding what seems like a good one  I ll complete half of it and then start looking for something else  Springboard s curriculum allowed me to stay on course and I trusted that what they put in front of me was going to be helpful in learning and ultimately getting a job  The frequent connection with my mentors  career coach  and other students was really helpful in knowing that I wasn t alone  It gave me a psychological edge in that someone I was meeting with at the end of the week was expecting me to complete assignments and be able to discuss them  This was a total career pivot for me and  so far  I m glad that I did it  I welcome any questions about my experience and the program'),(1172,3,15,'Purevdulam

I took it as a way to accelerate my career transition and be prepared to start a career in UX  There are plenty of bootcamps to choose from I ll highlight why I chose this   particular camp over the others  Why I chose Springboard The features that were most attractive to me were the mentorship with someone who has been in industry for a long time  the career coaching  a legitimate job guarantee clause  and the ability to self pace  Another very important feature was the curriculum of course  as it was something that gave me the accurate information in an industry with a lot of misinformation circulating  Mentorship It is important to have mentorship  as a good experienced designer s expertise empowered me to know I was achieving real success in my work throughout the course as all assignments were graded and reviewed  I also loved the weekly meetings with my mentor to discuss my work and any questions  Career Coaching Before the course I never had a good picture of how to network  job search or interview effectively  This was all covered and explained in the course and it was great to give me increased confidence in job search  which I always found intimidating before  Job Guarantee I did not need to use the job guarantee  as I got a job before the time period ended  I did review it and find it acceptable  especially because their requirements were designed to increase your chances of getting a job  You re required to continue building your network and required to apply to jobs  If you are a chrome user there is an extension that makes submitting the connections and job applications easy enough that it doesn t add too much work in addition to the job search its self  Self Paced I did this course while working a full time job  and it was quite a full schedule  The ability to time things on my own within the total course time requirement made me able to get ahead some weeks and have slack weeks when I simply didn t have time or availability  A Couple Challenges It s important to require excellence from yourself in your work  If you really want to do UX Design put your back into your work  as it doesn t do its self  While this may seem like a non statement  I want to point out that for a junior role there are often HUNDEREDS of applicants  This level of competition requires working hard to get things done  A second challenge is there is little education in the course for quantitative data gathering  which is very important in the actual field  A third challenge is I found out that they expect the course to take 8 months rather than the advertised 6  I don t appreciate the bait and switch feeling this gave me  That being said I put my back into it and almost completed it in 6 months  Springboard is not perfect  but it had what I

Springboard when I was looking at changing my career path  and my friend suggested I look into UX and the course Springboard offered  they had   never gone to Springboard  only heard of it  From my research  UX ended up being a field that intrigued and excited me but finding an online course that would work for me was the hinge point   specifically because I ve had poor experiences with work alone and remotely  Springboard s mentorship program and Job Guarantee  which I was eligible for  were the two factors that led me to choose them over other schools  Initially  the admission counselors told me that the course would be completely achievable within 6 months while continuing to work  which cemented my decision  The course is laid out in way that really grounds you in the concepts of UX and leads you through step by step  You learn the processes of research  interviews  affinity mapping  user personas  ideation  wireframing  prototyping  testing  and more  all on your capstone project  When that s completed  you take all the skills you ve learned and create a new project with a week in a modified Google Ventures design sprint  And lastly  you dip your toes into the real world as you re partnered with a real company to meet their UX needs over the course of a couple weeks  All this is laid out in an easy to follow curriculum that shows you exactly where you are and what s coming next  To me  the most effective and helpful part of Springboard is the plentiful mentorship they provide you and the Slack community of other students  Not only are you partnered with a great mentor who has spent years in the field  shout out Noemi  but you have access to all of the other mentors at Springboard to pick their brains and talk to them about the industry and field  Not only are there mentors for the curriculum  but for your career search too  And the Slack community allowed me to connect with plenty of other students where we could examine each other s work  commiserate about our projects  and give us a better sense that we re not doing this alone  For me  the negative of the course was the time estimate for how long the course would take  To be fair  I may be an  over worker  and putting more time and effort into some projects than was necessary  but I finished the course nowhere near the 6 month mark that was originally pitched  I was working on the course while working a remote job at the same time  and I finished the course nearly 4 months after my original end date  To Springboard s credit  they do have safety nets for those in my position  Because I could show I was actively working and had the support of my mentor  they had some extensions available for people in my situation  Thankfully  I was able to complete the entire course within the extensions that were available without having to pay for extensions or losing my job guarantee  Ultimately  I feel that the course has given me the tools and the mindset to enter into this new career and actually get a job  The mentorship program was essential for me to do my best and stay on track  and I don t think I would have had nearly the same experience without it  Their time estimates are extremely optimistic  unless maybe you re doing the course full time  but they do support the students who need it  If you are looking for a UX course  I would highly suggest

had some knowledge of UX going in  but the bootcamp filled in the gaps I had in user research  data synthesis  and design planning while allowing me to practice and level up the skills I already had  The curriculum was a great curation of reading  lectures  and interactive lessons  Maybe I wish there were a few more lectures to break up the heavy reading units  but that s nitpicking  On your first week  you get paired with a mentor who helps you apply your learning to a steady stream of projects  My mentor was great  She always had an insight or a resource to guide me and never got frustrated when I struggled or fell behind  You aren t graded in the traditional way  You review project progress with your mentor  and they give you feedback to make changes  It s technically pass fail  but in practice  it trades the stick and carrot for a kind of conversation that results in the best possible portfolio  Online learning is a different animal than in person learning  You have to be good at managing your time and staying focused  If you need the social element of a classroom  digesting lessons over Slack with your peers is a poor substitute  Communication on Slack felt transactional  I did make a good friend toward the end of the curriculum on a team project  but I wish Springboard did more to make student interaction meaningful early on  I m sure there are a few hiring managers

build your network  a resume  a portfolio  then teach you how to interview and negotiate  It s not just something you quietly know you should be doing in the background  they properly teach you and

jobs don t grow on trees  It s a very competitive market  I ll be the first to be straight with you about it  It s a bit like being both a businessman and an artist  We are here  mainly  to solve problems  They come in all varieties   such as socio economic issues  app functionality  matters of convenience and satisfaction  and visual aesthetics  It s hard to be good at them all  The UX career track at Springboard will give you your fair share of experience in each until you come to understand what it is about UX that you are best at  For me  it s research and strategy  I can hold my own all the way through the design process  but I find the most joy thinking about the why s  and bringing insights into design  I like to solve problems on a systemic level As for the course  it s a highly sufficient curriculum that has enabled me to feel confident as I continue to learn design  The program has well vetted UX mentors that are industry veterans and are quite successful  And  the team of career coaches I ve interacted with has been top quality  These people are true professionals and THEIR job is to get YOU a job  That s a promise But  it s still all on you  Make no mistake  A career transition isn t for the feint of heart  especially design  The good thing is that we are makers  so you should never stop making something  Never stop learning  and be courageous  And  be prepared to work for free or below your  paygrade   at first I am currently working on various passion projects that I will add to my portfolio in addition to the three projects I completed through the Springboard curriculum  Be mindful  you who are reading this  that UX isn t something you stop learning  I know there is a lot of information out there  though  and it can be overwhelming  Springboard was a great pathway for me to understand UX in principle and in process  But  don t stop with what they give you or it won t be enough  With that foundation of knowledge and experience  I ve been able to further investigate principles I enjoy  and find methods that fit my needs and specific style  Springboard teaches design thinking  but there are other umbrellas of UX understanding such as CX and User centered design  which Springboard introduces briefly Being a problem solver  I revolve around the core of UX  which is finding pain points  I ve also incorporated a problem solving framework called customer jobs aka jobs to be done  I m also investigating systems thinking and system s diagramming to use in tandem  These are just examples of many different UX frameworks you can add to your metaphorical toolbelt  Just find what you gravitate to  It s equally important to spend time designing and working with others  Other designers are your allies  but don t get too caught up in trying to be everyone s friend  Building meaningful relationships means being professional first  Add value to get value  Be genuine and authentic  seriously  Just be you Being you is very important because design interviews are really hard  You have to be tenacious the same as any jobsearch  but you are going to basically be auditioning many times during interview rounds  Jobs will want to see how you design and how you will work with their team  So  prepare well for the mock interviews  which are effectively the finals for the UX course  or you won t get the job guarantee that comes with the course  and you may not even get a job even after all that  But  without risk there is no reward  And  so long as you put 100  into your projects  you will be a confident enough designer to showcase your work in an interview I found a home in design because of Springboard  I truly believe that  My first love is writing  and always will be  But  I couldn t pass up the

calls as well  including Linkedin and resume reviews  The bootcamp didn t give you real interview offers though  I heard a data science bootcamp did this but not sure if this is something UX bootcamps do where they have connections that get their students hired  I heard some students in this bootcamp got hired by their internship partner though  The curriculum was informative  it is a combination of online articles and some articles written by Springboard mentors  These articles give more detail into UX topics and are good for referring back to  you get lifetime access to the curriculum after

over the same length of time  Additionally  springboard comes with a straight forward job guarantee  The quality of the course material is repellent  I m an avid learner and have taken many online courses through community colleges and state colleges  The amount of knowledge you gain and support you get from springboard makes universities look slow  petty  wasteful  unresourceful  and greedy  Much of the course material is drawn from online sources  but this is now common practice in higher academia  The coursework is highly informative and of sound quality  rivaling and surpassing the quality of a HCI course I took at PSU for example  What s more  at the end of the career track you will also have a portfolio and a website platform to showcase all your work   critiqued by senior designer to make sure it looks right  And a CV and cover letter that is evaluated by those same designers  You also get a weekly one on one mentor throughout the length of the course  My mentor  Ciarda  tailored every session to my needs  was efficient beyond compare  and was always accessible  You can also schedule help from additional mentors whenever you need  Finally  the administration of springboard is flexible  personable  and does right by its students  I had the intention to complete the 6 month track within 3 months  I was on the month to month payment option so this would make the course  2 000 less for me  There were a few set backs that pushed me a couple days past this deadline  The career track manager  Dave  very kindly worked with me through the obstacles to make sure everything worked out fairly  Going into it  I was worried a bootcamp might just be another form of degree mill  The company isn t about extorting students for money  but really wants to empower

curated and the mentors I came into contact with were all very professional and helpful  I am not sure that this program is for everyone but that has nothing to do with Springboard  If you re not a

also loved the professional research presentation and portfolio walkthrough I was matched with some amazing UX professionals who gave me invaluable feedback and assured me of my talent and abilities  The only con I can really think of is that the course is essentially designed in a linear fashion and students often do not look through future units when they re working on something already  However  with the industry project and several presentations and mock interviews in the latter part of the course  time allocation and planning can become tricky if students want to finish the course in a

Springboard s  SB  UX Career Track because with the job guarantee in place and affordable tuition  I felt reassured that it would   be the quickest and efficient means to get into a new industry  Now that I m done  I believe this was one of the wisest decisions I ve made  What I liked the most about SB is that it is designed to be very resource conscious  and even though they are an online program  you actually get a lot of one to one real life interaction  They are genuinely invested in your learning and success  and everyone I ve engaged with through the SB network from the administrative staff to mentors to fellow coursemates are really smart and supportive individuals  You don t get the impression that they are just  running a business  or scheming to milk your every dime  The entire experience was very human The curriculum is also very thoughtfully designed  Even though at first I thought the idea of  curated content  rather than  original content  may be a downside  I have come to appreciate it  Because we are reading materials written by multiple people on similar subject matters  I have a better feel of the overall disciplinary discussions out there  and I feel like the knowledge is something I could confidently fall back on Even though this is an online remote program  I am glad to see that over time SB is investing in more in person activities and interactions  such as onsite community events  One of the three projects we had to complete was an industry design project  IDP  where we get paired with a start up to do real client work  My student advisor  Dave Weiner  Hi Dave  thoughtfully paired me up with a company that works with education  since I came from academia myself  The office of the start up was also located really close to where I live  so I actually got to visit the office and meet the team in real life  Because of this human thoughtfulness  the whole internship experience unfolded much more smoothly and successfully  and in the end  I got hired back as full time staff without having to go through endless rounds of resume  re writing  etc The fact that the industry project turned into a real full time position really helped me get the foot in the door  which is the hardest step really  so I don t take it lightly  But even without that luck  I do believe that in the current product job market  having real work experience is more important than learning of any shape and form  so having the IDP as one of the units was a huge advantage  Hopefully  SB will continue to invest in the IDP internship program and expand their professional network  so that more students can continue to benefit'),(1408,3,26,'Jackie Smith','False',2018,'True','2019-07-10','2019-07-10','5.0','5.0','5.0','5.0','The pro of this course is that as

and approved by professional Data Analysts who tell you were you went astray and give hints to improve  In my opinion the self learning works great if you have a job or other studies beside the boot

best for you  which for me is mostly in the middle of the night  Also  while Practicum has great tutors and a Slack community where you you can post every questions you might have  in the end learning

Practicum has a good and detailed course structure  The material is well written and easy to understand  There are 12 projects that become part of your portfolio once you finish  I completed 6 projects so far and I found them engaging  Of course  they were challenging  but believe it or not  this is the real deal  I d also like to highlight the dedicated support team  My cohort is guided by a professional tutor and a very friendly community manager  Also  there s a senior student who makes sure that my questions and queries are answered promptly  I got lucky with my group mates  and it s a great feeling when you can discuss stuff with them  Every two weeks our tutor organizes live coding webinars where upcoming projects are explained and there s a Q amp A session as well  At the end of the program  there s going to be the career acceleration part and I m so excited about that  One thing that I d like to say though is that the work of the platform could be improved because sometimes it can be slow  But it happens rarely and it gets fixed pretty quickly  The Practicum team are always improving the course and they are very open about the feedback they receive  They are

exercises and projects pretty challenging so you can feel the growing confidence after completing it  All projects are get checked by an industry professionals  They provide really valuable feedback  Sometime you may need to correct and resubmit the project several times until it is done correctly and accepted by reviewer  During the program  I completed 12 projects and one additional project  so the portfolio is pretty impressing  Another great part of the program are biweekly webinars  During the webinar  students could see the how the data analyst works on different real life problems and real time coding sessions  The webinars give more live interactions to the program The program teaches all technical and soft skills needed to junior data analyst    Python programming language with libraries like Pandas  Matplotlib  Seaborn  Plotly  etc    Jupiter Notebook  SQL queries and data processing  Data preprocessing with Python  Exploratory and statistical data analysis  Business

would be worth it for a better life  The instructions and interactive course were clear  and it used examples and explanations to drive the point across in a way you can understand  After the week

questions and post them in their respective forums  so that students and tutors can respond  Other times I needed a more detailed explanation and a tutor is always more than willing to hop on a video

I wanted to do  I looked into Practicum s different programs  Data Analyst  Data Scientist  Software Engineer  and ultimately decided on Software Engineer because it was the area that I had the least

optional things you can change to make your code better  They promise to give you feedback within 24 hours of submitting your project  and I ve found that to be true  a lot of times I ll submit a

went through a few free HTML and CSS courses to try to learn more  I graduated high school a little over a year ago and I knew that I didn t want to go to college to learn how to create software  as

caught my eye as it was more of a part time course that lasted a longer duration  ensuring that I could take my time through the program to learn correctly and not get burnt out  I took the free course that they offered  which took about 8 hours  and I really took to the tasks that the platform offered  as it allowed me to learn things on my own time and at my own pace  I started the full Software Engineer course soon after  I m nearly finished with the course  being about 8 months through at this point  and I have enjoyed the program completely  The tasks are good at introducing new material and can be revisited at any time throughout the course  which I took advantage of when working on the projects  The projects are the best part of the course though and have been the driving force of my learning while studying at Practicum  Doing the projects have gotten me to remember and utilize the concepts learned through the tasks and apply what I have learned to life like projects

the forums are high  and you are told at how successful you are going to be after this course  Once they have your money after a few months  the plane   crashes into the mountain  I signed up believing their website that I would have 10 unique projects to add to my portfolio  Sounds great right  What they really mean is you will re do a project over and over again and by the end you will have ONE project for your portfolio  I am at the end of the course and I am still working  Web project 4  which is just a continuation of everything  This was an outright lie  I took screen shots showing their claim of 10 projects  After a month or two   I also mentioned this in a complaint  the website was changed to say 6 projects  Thanks for that Practicum  Now im sure it says something vague  Next grievance is the lack of support for international students  This is a Russian company after all  but good luck getting an answer to your question outside of a few hours in the afternoon Eastern Time  All of the tutors have a full time job and usually do their tutoring work at the end of the day  This means that unless you live in the US  a tutor will NEVER be available when you want to work  Another lie from Practicum  The forums  slack channel after a few months is completely dead  I wouldn t be surprised if I was the only person in my group  It really seems that everyone dropped out of the course  The platform is alright to work on  however  you will reach extremely vague questions and obviously no one is around to help you  So have fun with that  One tip is to beg the IT support people  who are supposed to just help with syntax errors  and sometimes you will get someone who is willing to help you  Very often though  they will say  ask your tutor    I would if I had one  The React and Express sprints are just cheap rip offs of the official website s documentation with some not very funny jokes spliced in  I would recommend learning it directly from them  React even offers a free course  or you could just pay Practicum for their version of the same thing  My final grievance is that they vastly undersold how much you will be working on the course   20 hours per week  they say  it will be more like 30 to 40  You will never finish a sprint on time  you will constantly feel like a failure  and you will end up hating it  My advice to you would be to save your money  do some free courses until you find a programing language you enjoy  get certified in it  and MOVE ON  I did this course when they did a trial offer of 2000 euros  Now it s 5000  not sure why  IMO the quality went down as soon as they got your money  TLDR   Practicum kinda sucks I AM KEEPING MY REVIEW ANONYMOUS SO THEY DON T BOOT ME FROM THE COURSE FOR EXPOSING HOW BAD IT IS pros  You will find new reasons to hate yourself and feel like a failure  Some of the tutors are helpful   about 50  of them Cons  Lying about the number of projects you will have for your portfolio  I HAVE

curriculum teaches students not only how to code  but also how to work in the industry  The base curriculum covers software engineering foundations before diving deep in the most popular frameworks in use today  The curriculum is taught in  sprints  meaning that chapters are learned in two week sessions that begin with theory and practice on Practicum s custom learning platform  and end with real life projects that students can include in their portfolios  Throughout each sprint  students have a chance to learn from a tutor dedicated to their cohort  as well as other students further along in the course  some dedicated specifically to their cohort as well  Practicum s code review process provides students with feedback in a way that models industry practices as well  This feedback is invaluable in deepening understanding of topics learned throguhout each sprint  Practicum s Apiary program  a free and optional extra curricular  gives students a chance to work on small teams to build real projects for real companies  I participated in three of these projects and cannot emphasize enough how valuable they were for me  Learning to collaborate with others  learning to adopt newtechnologiess to solve unique problems  and learning what it feels like to build  real  projects gave me a massive leg up in the interview process  After graduation  the Career Acceleration program

found Practicum and I was captivated by the promise of taking a total newbie like me and making them into data scientists at the end of the course  I was skeptical at first but decided to try it  and the results were mind blowing  Firstly  Practicum has an interactive platform which is really helpful  especially for people who do not own powerful computers  You can code directly on the platform and use Practicum s servers to run your code  It s like a plug and play experience  Also  there are many real life projects on the platform and so you get thrown into the action really quickly and end up graduating with a pretty impressive portfolio  Secondly  the support team  learning team  and slack community are all top notch  They work 24hrs a day and so you can ask a question at any point of

reviewers than ensure you completed it correctly  Overall the idea is very efficient and works well  attempting to find criticisms would just be a list of mostly small complaints  Sometimes the tutors

code they will almost certainly tell you to ask your tutor instead  which you can through their Slack channel which you re almost required to if you want to have a clear line of communication with the

began by trying to learn data science on my own  but was quickly overwhelmed by how much there was to learn  Enter Practicum by Yandex  From the very start of this program  we were given modules in 2 week sprints  Each module consisted of a chapter of material we need to review  tasks for each section of the chapter  and a project  The chapter generally took a few days to go through  and the project about one week  with the grading procedure  When completing the projects  the code is scrutinized by practicing data scientists  and they often provide important feedback that may not have been covered in the course material  On the data science track  you start with learning how to program in python and use data analysis libraries  You then move on to conducting data analysis and statistical analysis  During this time  you practice data visualization in your projects and learn how to structure notebooks  Once the data analysis portion of the program is complete  you branch off into machine learning  which I found most interesting  Each module covers some important aspect of machine learning  and each project sees you building your own model  or oftentimes multiple models  With all that I ve learned at Yandex  I ve been able to participate in data science competitions and have scored in the top 10  This is something I know I couldn t have done on my own  and for that I am extremely grateful to Yandex  I will say  I was a bit apprehensive at the start of the program because I saw that the price for the bootcamp was quite a bit lower than similar bootcamps  I guess this must be because lower operating costs  because I honestly could not find anything to complain about  They offer great lessons  robust feedback  constant support through Slack  and a genuinely nice community to be a part of  Having just completed the course this week  I was sad to think that I would be leaving the community now  Amazingly  Yandex had something else up it s sleeve   a career

courses about data science  but the advertisement for this course was all over there and I could not ignore it  It had been half a year since I have started learning on this platform and I have few things about it  First of all  I would say that the course content is straight forward and gathered together  which creates a convenient environment  Secondly  the teaching process is mostly project based  which means that this school prioritizes self learning  Last  but not least important feature of this school is that the community is friendly  you can easily discuss your progress and have consultations  get feedback about your projects so that you could spot your issues on time  instructors are available and ready to communicate 24 7  Most favorite part of the course is that it emphasizes self learning  I would say that this is the most important asset of accelerating on computer science fields nowadays  I definitely recommend this course to those who are seeking the best

work as Sr Graphic Design  this gave me a great foundation for visual design before moving on to focus solely on User Experience and   Product design  My career was mostly self started and I felt like I reached a stage in my career where I wanted some fundamental training in User Experience design to address some areas where I thought I could improve  As a designer it s very important to have strong instincts that will help guide you through the design process  Knowing what steps to take next could sometimes mean researching  sketching  gathering feedback  iterating or handing off designs to be implemented  It is crucial for a designer to be able to see projects through by knowing when to move into certain phases of the design cycle  On the job these learnings would come at a great cost to both the company and the designer  not knowing what to do next can really put you at a disadvantage when your team is looking at you to decide next steps  Brainstations curriculum shows the learner how to move a project from ideation to implementation  The course is focused on the design thinking process and how that relates to User Experience design  Empathizing with the user as the first step in the UX design process helps the designer define what the problem looks like  Then using UX design principles like information architecture  sketching  wireframing  and prototyping to build on those insights  Finally testing  presenting and gathering feedback are all used to help the designer communicate their ideas in a way that allows them to iterate and push the designs further Additionally Brainstation s User Experience design course helps you speak the language of user experience design so you can communicate design decisions with your product team  Vocabulary is such an important part of understanding the design industry and when you finish this course you will have an intimate knowledge of terminology used daily by ux design professionals  My cohort features 2 instructors  one who worked at an e commerce giant and the other who worked at a well known design agency  They were extremely engaging with the course material offering plenty of opportunities to work with the class and try out the techniques that were covered  They both gave the students a lot of room to ask questions and even stayed on after the class to answer more questions The class project will leave you with work that you could put in your portfolio if you are just starting off  These will make great conversation pieces in interviews because you will be able to speak about the entire process of design whereas some work that designers get when they are just starting off will be mostly visual and not include the important research steps that interviews want to hear about  Overall the course covers a lot of material in a very short amount of time  I recommend taking lots of notes that you can refer back to  Each lesson also comes with some resources and demos of products that you can use to help you as a designer  Lastly the course is a great networking opportunity  I was able to meet a lot of passionate design learners as well as the 2 instructors and being

and developers  but decided to formalize my knowledge and understanding of UX  Brainstation s UX Design course is a comprehensive   hands on look into the User Experience process  In ten weeks  you take a project from theory  to research  planning  testing and designing a solution including functional prototypes  Because you are taken through the various steps  you can also experience and determine which part of UX Design excites you most   is it the research phase  design  testing    which will help you decide which direction to take your career in  Alternatively  for those already working with UX Design teams  it provides you with the skills to better understand the process and places you in a better position to work with those teams collaboratively going forward  The instructors themselves work in the field and have hands on experience as UX Designers  In my class  we had two instructors   one working at a start up who is responsible for the entire UX process  the other working at a large corporation in a group and focused on the design aspect only  They shared real life examples and experiences  and also suggestions of how to prepare a portfolio and interviews  They were collaborative and took the time to work with each student to brainstorm and work through design solutions to ensure what the student is creating is the best user experience  This course provides you with all the tools needed to take a project from beginning to end  and then work on your own after the course to repeat the cycle and develop a portfolio  Your fellow students come from all backgrounds  experiences and career levels and you create a whole new network of people to tap

course on campus in Vancouver  BC and this summer I took the User Interface course online  They were both one night a week for 10 weeks  The quality of both courses   was excellent  I like the 10 week format because I need time to really absorb what I am learning  The product management course is offered over 5 full time days  or was last year anyway  and I really don t think I would have learned as much  With the 10 week format there was enough time to actually do the homework each week  If you keep up with it one night a week of doing homework is enough  but for me it is hard to find time  I actually tried to do a 5 week accelerated program  the User Experience Design course  but I got sick and only went to 2 classes  Still that was almost half of the course and it was way too fast  I just barely got the homework done but didn t really spend enough time to absorb what I was doing  If you are used to taking courses and or are not working full time you should look at the 5 week accelerated programs though  They are the exact same material as the 10 week ones  just twice as fast My teacher in both of the courses I finished were really great  They were both working industry professionals with a ton of experience  One is a VP even  This was the part that I liked the best  they both shared a LOT of information in addition to the slides such as showing us real documents designs roadmaps etc that they had worked on for various projects  Being able to see what the real work looks like really helped me understand the topics we covered in each lesson and also gave me confidence at work that what I was producing was the correct thing or in the correct format  Also both courses had teaching assistants and I liked both of them a lot too  It was good having two different instructors available because we got to hear two different experiences  The only downsides I can share is that the online course just had way too many people in my class but that is probably because it was the first session after the pandemic started  The 5 week course I started was also online but had 2 3 the number of students  But overall everyone is really great there  In fact I withdrew from that 5 week course halfway through and then was allowed to register in the UI course instead once I was no longer sick and that was As far as diversity goes I had 2 white instructors  an Indian instructor  a Black instructor  and an Asian instructor  All my instructors were men but in each of the classes I would guess half of the class was female  I know that there are female instructors also as I know a couple but my instructors were all men  All of the BrainStation employees I interacted with aside from teachers for all 3 courses were women  So I would say I interacted with an equal number of male and female employees at Brainstation and of all ethnicities  I really learned a lot in both courses and I 10000  have used stuff from these courses at work  I had to take on the role of Product Manager for 6 months at the planning phase of a new product while we looked for a full time PM and I was completely armed and prepared to do that  There were some bumps along the way  especially as I learned to translate the  student project  level of my knowledge into real business deliverables   and learned how to make slide decks from scratch   BrainStation final projects come with a template you can use if you want so you don t have to be great at that stuff to do the course  I can safely say that I outperformed expectations of me and I owe the credit completely to the Product Management course The User Interface Design course that I took I finished it just recently after handing off the role of PM to our new permanent product manager  I took this one for me  not for work  I always had this mental block against graphics  I was convinced I couldn t do anything that involved graphics  So I decided to force myself through it by taking this course  Don t get me wrong  I struggled  This design stuff does not come to me naturally and although the software is pretty straight forward when there was something that I couldn t figure out it was really hard  Plus my designs were not great  But by the end of the course I was using the software and my designs were pretty good  I am not a natural talent  I ll need to keep working on it if I really want to get to a professional level  but where I m at now is pretty good  The app I designed looked better than a lot of apps I ve seen  I was pretty happy with what I learned and how much I grew and got over my fears in this course  There isn t a lot of instruction on how to use the programs nor how to s on making designs graphics themselves but instead the course teaches a lot about the theory of User Interface Design and you do designs as the course goes  working on your final project a bit each week  applying what you have learned  For some people that worked out well  For me it was hard because I spent a lot of time trying to learn the software  I ended up buying a  15 Udemy course on how to use sketch and I spent a week watching that  After I did that I found I was able to really apply what I was learning and doing the designs wasn t as frustrating  or pointless  as before I am a mobile developer so I already had the code part but whenever I tried to make an app it was always extremely ugly  I m really looking forward to using my design skills and product management knowledge to plan some apps'),(1531,5,44,'Stephanie L

course  The NY campus  in the heart of Soho  is an absolutely beautiful and inspiring space to learn in  The UX course proved to be challenging in a good way and I was very keen to follow it up with the UI course  At that point  Covid had hit and I was WFH but luckily the course easily adapted to being online through Zoom  Because of the global pandemic situation  one of my fellow students found himself stuck in Belgium but he still called into every class at 3am in the morning The UI course was a bit easier for me than the UX course as I already knew some of the content around visual language such as typography best practices  However  other content more specific to digital was new to me such as the grid system and responsive design  The course also helped reinforce skills that I had learnt in the UX course such as how to use software like Sketch  Our tutor  John Kantor  was a pleasure to learn from as he explained things well whilst also keeping up a good pace  I also enjoyed it when he shared his own professional experiences with us  He made himself available through Slack for if we needed help whilst working on our projects outside of class time  When I reached out with a question  he responded within the hour  He also provided links to additional resources that helped reinforce what we were learning With this course  as with most part time learning  there is not the time to master skills in each class so you need to do that in your own time and it is a case of getting out of it what you put in  Due to being stuck at home  I was able to put in many free hours on

background in post secondary admissions and marketing  The 5 weeks went by very quickly  and it was very manageable with work as the classes are in the evening  There is definitely a lot to learn and a lot to go through in a short amount of time  so do expect the need to do additional research and practice on the side to help grasp concepts  Completing the homework is also helpful  and self learning is a necessary part of the course  Instructor Ramin was knowledgeable  friendly and able to use real life examples as a Data Analyst himself   I always find having experienced instructors is important  Tuition is a tad pricey for a short basic course  but you can contact their Advisors and ask about scholarships and financial aid  Overall  I would recommend this course to those who are in

blocks  Excel  MySQL and Tableau  The first two classes were about working in Excel from basics to more advanced level  and it was ok  I understand that it was a necessity  and lots of students come with different levels of experience  Although I wish we either focused more on advanced Excel or covered that material within one class  After that  we moved on to MySQL and I found that part of the course the most interesting and exciting  For the next 4 classes  we were learning basic as well as advanced commands in MySQL Workbench and participating in the class exercises  The last three classes were with Tableau  where I wish we had more assignments and tasks to do  Somewhere in the middle  we were broken into teams to prepare for our Final projects  And that was the most important part of the class  While you get all the necessary knowledge with Brainstation to get started  a major part of learning comes from the work that you do outside of the class  I cannot even describe the amount of reading I had to do to solve one problem that was standing on our way  By putting extra time into learning I ended up feeling very confident in my knowledge and skills  Now I understand that you don t always get to choose your teammates  but I got very lucky  My team was great  and we were working in sync until the end of the course  Communication was the key and I could clearly see the teams that had such a problem in their final presentations  By working together you can really create an amazing experience and enjoy the process  Our instructor was Ramin Amin  who over the length of the course was very direct in his approach  and could explain the material very well  I have to admit that the level of support that he provided outside of the class was just great  Anytime I had a

week course underwhelming compared to the  3000  price point  Having completed both a undergraduate and graduate degree online as well as several certification courses  I am disappointed with the class setup  It heavily follows a basic PowerPoint  instructors do elaborate with their own experiences  and rather then using the spare time to give live examples of the information in practice  they give final project time for the students to work  Then after 45min   hour you resume and the class is asked if anyone wants to share without them being encouraged to show their screen  Based on my overall experience so far  I wouldn t suggest this to anyone having to pay out of pocket  For  300 LinkedIn Learning will provide detail hands on examples while they cover each topic  The only

experience of the instructor  Not only was our instructor Scott super knowledgeable and experienced but was also a great teacher  He broke down   the concepts nicely and shared a lot of examples from his work life which made the application of all the marketing concepts very real and easier to appreciate  Given the whole Covid situation  Brainstation s Online Live format cannot be beat  You log in from the convenience of your home and the platform uses great collaboration tools like Zoom  Slack and their own Synapse platform which makes the learning experience very interactive and cohesive  I definitely miss that in the other online courses that are either not live or simply lack the maturity in terms of collaboration tools and software  Kudos to the Brainstation leadership team for their thought leadership and vision in launching this truly online and digital learning platform2 	Breadth of course and quality of content  Digital marketing is a vast field and not an easy topic to cover within a 10 12 week part time learning format  This is another area where Brainstation did an excellent job  They organized Digital Marketing into 8 areas and covered all key channels such as SEO  SEM  social media and email marketing  It served as a great introduction and their slide content was great in terms of simplifying the concepts and quoting relevant examples from time to time  3 	Duration of course  This is a key component of any online learning course  If a course goes on for too long and it feels like a drag causing you to lose interest  cut it too short and you feel like you did not get enough out of the course  I feel like Brainstation got this right at 10 week course duration  I feel like a 10 12 week duration is optimal at least for someone like me who wants to do many things and tends to lose interest easily  4 	Specialty focus on FB If you know even a little about Digital Marketing you know that FaceBook is the king of all digital marketing platforms and simply cannot be beat  Their acquisitions of IG and WhatsApp have only made them stronger  I love that Brainstation decided to make FB the focus social media platform and dedicates a significant portion of the course to helping understand FaceBook s comprehensive advertising platform  I also realized that once I got a good understanding of FB  it got much easier to pick up any new social media marketing platform  5 	Sense of community and continued learning This was one of the most important differentiators for me  Although this was an online course  I felt very connected to the entire Brainstation community

engaging you by including you in all the relevant collaboration and communication platforms  You make a lot of good connections with folks in the digital marketing world such as your instructor

those topics  The instructors for   digital marketing in Vancouver are both awesome and very willing to answer questions both during class and throughout the rest of the week  I think the biggest pro of the digital marketing course is definitely the instructors and their ability to explain the content to a wide range of people who either have a lot of experience with what they re talking about  or none at all  Another positive part of the experience for me was the space and learning environment  The classroom is very beautiful and is available to students throughout the week to use if they want

beginning of the course and assigned a local business for whom you will create a digital marketing strategy by the end of the ten weeks  While I think that this is a good idea in the sense that while you are learning topics you are able to apply them directly and immediately to your assigned business for your project  I ultimately would rather hear more examples about what companies are ALREADY doing as opposed to trying to figure out what a specific company COULD be doing  I would like to be able to learn the content without having to apply it to a specific company  or maybe just learn it without so much emphasis on applying it to that company  It s probably a personal learning thing but I would like more big picture understandings of different kinds of strategies rather than learning a topic and putting it just toward your project  Other than that  I think that the course is awesome and I have really enjoyed my time learning all this information  I would  and have  definitely

Science and Machine Learning certificate programs  and I ll be commenting on the Data Science one here  First off  the instructors I ve had have been top notch  Andrew was my   instructor this go round  and it was evident that this guy works data science for a living  You can tell by the way he codes  changes code on the fly at such speed  and debugs code when it s not working  He also seems to be genuinely enchanted with Data Science as a whole  He answered all questions  even my dumb questions  clearly and cleanly  The course content itself is solid  I highly recommend you know Python prior to taking this course  rather than just knowing a programming language in general  Everything is coded in Python from day 1  to include using some more  advanced  features like list comprehensions  so having a good grasp of Python I think is integral to your experience with these courses  The only thing I really wasn t high on in the course content was the Statistics section  it s simply too large and broad of a topic to cover in the scope of this course  In my opinion  a basic statistics background should already be had before jumping into Data Science  Most classes and topics are like that  but the statistics portion really stuck out to me  Jupyter notebooks are provided  so the material is flexible and easy to work with  The instructors provide solutions included notebooks after the lessons  which is handy for someone like me that wants to watch them work the problems and then figure them out in my own manner later  Due to the nature of these part time courses  and the material covered in such a short time  don t expect to just listen to lectures and be good at Data Science  You will need to work through the Jupyter notebooks on your own time  and do additional research on your own as well  This should be expected for anyone who has ever coded before  but for those who might think it s a sit back and learn it all class  it s not that easy  A hanging point for some people is that there s no  job guarantee  or assistance with BrainStation  To those folks  I ask you do you truly believe that you re going to get a dream job out of a bootcamp s career assistance or guarantees  I think it s a worthless perk for the average student because you re going to have to know your stuff to be successful in the field anyway  and if you don t know your stuff  you re probably not going to stay in that job long even if it s given to you  It may work out for some  but I didn t see it as a requirement  Overall  I would recommend BrainStation to

my job due to covid   Learning about digital marketing had been in my mind for years now  but it was one of those things that I didn t pursue before because of time  routine  being comfortable at work  etc  The overall experience was very positive  starting with the learning advisors that made the time to answer every question I had and really walked me through the whole process step by step   The program was fast paced  I can t emphasize this enough  This is a challenging program that requires your full attention and dedication  I understand every student is different  but in my case  this was the only thing I was able to work on during those 3 months  Between lectures and working on my projects I probably spent around 60 hours per week  The program was challenging but in a very positive way  At first  I was a little bit intimidated by it  especially after 13 years since I attended school  but I was able to adapt very quickly with the support of my educators  my classmates  and family  I would define my overall experience taking this program as  the perfect storm   right timing  right educators  and right classmates  The educators  Josh Muirhead and Justin Lowe  were amazing  both of them leaders in their area of expertise and now with a commitment to share their knowledge in order to help shape a new generation of digital marketers  Learning from them was one of the most rewarding experiences during this time  The instructors  styles of teaching were very different but in my opinion  I feel we received a very well balanced learning experience  The content was relevant  the examples they used were always current with what s happening in the industry  and we were always encouraged to seek extra sources of information to stay updated with newer digital marketing trends   The introduction of the capstone project wasn t only a perfect exercise to apply everything that we learned throughout the course but also the perfect output to start our own portfolio to use

to learn React  Without this scholarship  it s practically impossible for me to enroll in Udacity React Nanodegree Program  not to talk of   learning React with Udacity because I don t have a job  no source of income  no business and no investment of any kind  Back to the question  How s the program going  Well  I must confess that this program is awesome  It s going on smoothly with my end  as expected  At the beginning  when I first started the program  I became frustrated  confused and annoyed with myself  Why  Because the course was too complicated for me  I m a novice when it comes to React  But when I started watching the videos and reading the documentations  downloading and watching other video tutorials from YouTube  and studying React documentations very well  the course became much more easier for me to comprehend  and I was able to follow up with the instructor  Back to the question  How has it matched my needs and expectations  Great question  I ve been expecting Udacity to ask me this question before now  But thank God that you ask  The Udacity s React Nanodegree Program has influenced my life positively  At Udacity  you will not only be given challenges such as quizzes  and exercises to solve  and projects to build  but you will also be thought how to think  That s one of the things this program has done to me  It has change my perspective the way I used to view problems before as something that has no solution  But this course has thought me to be viewing every problem I encounter in life as temporary challenge that can be solved  And Udacity has taught me how to think through every challenge  and proffer solutions to them every challenge has solution which can be done in different ways  This program really matched my needs and expectations via the Udacity s features that this program provides  which include   1  The Course Curriculum The learning program is flexible  not rigid  The course curriculum is designed in a way that is tailored to my busy life  It gives me the opportunity to learn at my own pace  and reach my personal goals on the schedule that works best for me  I usually invested a minimum of 6 8 hours a day to study the course  Meaning that I usually spend 42   56 hours per week  working on this React course  And the program is offline  and those not have a specific time that is fixed to study the course in a day  The course is splilted into 3 category   React Fundamentals In this category  I learn React s component models  with which I was able to write declarative  composable user interfaces to build production ready apps  React and Redux When my app s state becomes difficult to maintain  I now know that it s time to add Redux  In this section  I learn Redux how to manage complicated state to build enterprise level apps  React native In this lesson  I learn the fundamental differences between web and native applications as well as the main differences between React and React Native API  Along the lesson  I take a glimpse at the differences between developing for IOS and Android as well  Unlike the other lessons  I found this one confusing and frustrating sometimes  The part about the AsyncStorage API  which was a React Native version of localStorage  is outdated  The course material provides references to an implementation of it that was deprecated  For now  you can still use the implementation that they teach you at the course  but you will get this warning  AsyncStorage has been extracted from the react native core and will be removed from a future release  It can now be installed and imported from  react native community async storage  instead of  react native  Another outdated part I would like to point out in this Udacity React Nanodegree review is about React Navigation  At least this time the course material does mention that an updated version of React Navigation was released  but the videos in the course cover the older version of it  So  when you watch the videos you have to go through the documentation to see how the same thing is done in the newest version  The other confusing and frustrating part of this lesson is about local notifications  Expo s latest version changed the Notifications API syntax  so if you install its latest version  which you probably will  and follow the course material  you might get confused  In conclusion  this lesson was disappointing to me  Taking into consideration the price of this course  in this lesson I had to put down the course material and explore the documentation more than I expected  All I m saying in essence is that in this course  I have been able to get real employable skills  The curriculum is designed with top tier industry partners  not academics  so I learn the high impact skills that top companies want   2  Project based  active learning In this course  I learn by doing with real world projects  React Fundamentals MyReads  React Redux Would You Rather  and in React Native Mobile Flashcards  and other hands on exercises that lead to real skills mastery  In MyReads project I create a web application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read  are currently reading  or want to read  What I like the most about the Udacity projects is that they explain what you need to do and then they give you the Project Rubric  which is kind of your guidelines to see if you met all the project s specifications  Additionally  there is a step by step guide for building the app with a planning stage and a coding stage  If you are lost and don t know where to start or what to do next  this guide will give you a direction to follow  Let me make it clear in this review of Udacity s react nanodegree that it is not a tutorial where the instructor develops all the features in videos and you kind of code along  You have to do it all by yourself  In project 2  Would You Rather  I build a web app that lets the user play the  Would You Rather  Game  answering and asking questions in the form  Would you rather A or B  This project helps me solidify what I ve learned of React and Redux in a fun and creative way  It took me less time to develop this one  I think it was approximately 1 week  It was less stressful as well because you can look at the  Chirper  project and the lesson s material when you are not sure how to implement a concept  In Project 3  Mobile Flashcards  I build a mobile application   IOS or Android   or both  that allows users to create decks and a collection of cards in each deck  In each card  the user enters a question and an answer for that question  saving it to the correspondent deck  Whenever he she wishes to revise the content of a deck  he she can start that deck s quiz  This project is a great opportunity to practice the parts of the lesson that was confusing or outdated  such as the react native community AsyncStorage implementation  the React Navigation latest version  and the Expo Notifications latest syntax  I develop this application for both IOS and Android because there are some differences between the platforms that are important to be aware of  not only in terms of design or user experience but in terms of the implementation of the functionalities as well  As in all the Udacity assessment projects  they give you a Project Rubric to make sure your solution meets all the required specifications before you submit it to the technical review  This serves as kind of guidelines to me to see if I meet all the project s specifications  I love this one as well   3  Project review and Project feedback from experienced reviewers of Udacity s React Nanodegree The project reviews are one of the differentiating aspects of the Udacity course  I found them very useful and professional  not to mention the boost of confidence you get in your projects knowing that someone sanctioned your work   4  Learn on your schedule Udacity courses are all self paced learning   whenever and wherever you want  I m so much excited that I can now graduate while learning part time for 10 hrs week  at least   5  Technical mentor support The help you need  when you need it  Reach out to Udacity s mentors 24 7 and have your coding questions answered quickly so you can keep learning  I used the Mentorship a couple of times when I was stuck in one of the projects  There is a platform called Knowledge where you can search for answers to questions similar to yours or post new questions related to your project or lessons  I didn t post new questions because what I was looking for was already there  The solution I found there helped me move on   6  Student community which is now highly improved   7  Career services I ll have access to resume support  Github portfolio review and LinkedIn profile optimization that help me advance my career and land a high paying role  With all these features at Udacity  I have been transformed from an old me  novice in React Native  to a new

the Intro To Programming NanoDegree class in Jan 2020  as part of a New Year s goal to learn some programming basics  and see if I enjoy it  I found a coupon code that made the class come to around  150 month  so my total investment is   around  600  I liked the idea of having structure around my learning  and the ability to get a NanoDegree though I have no clue what it is worth  I was computer  savy  and have a background in science and startups  but didn t know a single line of code  After  5 months  here are my thoughts The good    I found out that I do enjoy programming    I learned a lot of the  basics  for HTML  CSS  JaveScript  Python  Git  GitHub  the shell  etc  that I had no clue about beforehand    I love python and am excited to create future programs in that  Also planning to start studying Java on my own    The first 6  Lessons  were super great and really taught me the basics and FORCED me to practice  The bad  After the first 6 lessons  starting with the  Intro to Python  Part 3  and continuing into the  Intro to JavaScript  the quality of the lessons and content went drastically down hill  The teacher videos were awkwardly dorky  a dance party of developer eating donuts  wtf  the lessons had tons of errors  bad links  and no answer keys or feedback on best practices for an answer  They basically just pulled content from other NanoDegrees and programs  and  pasted  it all hodge podge into this NanoDegree  so it didn t flow  and often didn t make sense    They would teach you do to one thing  like write variables in JS as  var  and then in the class projects tell you not to use  var  but to use  const  because  var  is outdated  Without explaining    They ended 1 1 mentors right as I was getting to where having a mentor would have been nice    They keep pushing their  help     student  community rooms  but they are super hard to interact with in a way that provides value  It would honestly be better if they used Slack or something  instead of their own version    If you want to cancel your automatic payments  they force you to talk to a slow responding chat bot for 20 minutes  Super sketch  And bad customer service    The career services is basically useless for someone just starting out with no previous knowledge in the  Intro to Programming  NanoDegree  They should remove that feature  and lower the cost  Might keep more customers that way  There is no way that only completing the  Intro to Programming  degree will get you a job as a developer  At least looking at my skills  and I m not a dummy  I doubt I could get something  They should have you do  projects  that are more usable in real life  Sure  who doesn t love an adventure game in python  but something like a tool that manipulates spreadsheets would be much more useful  Plus  who plays  Rock Paper Scissors  with a computer So  in conclusion  If you have the time to dig in and complete the program in 1  max 2 months  it is probably worth it  My wife had our 2nd kid  I have 2 full time businesses  and another venture finance class I was taking  so it took me longer than I wanted  especially after the baby was born  to finish  just submitted the last required project today  It got me going  I now know the basics  and am inspired to learn more    It made me do the work  I finished  cause I want my silly  600 NanoDegree  If you want the most bang for the buck  and you are brand new to programming  finish the first 6 lessons in the first month  then cancel and use YouTube videos to learn JavaScript and how to use GitHub  I ll probably get some books now as well  And I ll probably just start trying to make things'),(1685,6,72,'Chase','False',2020,'True','2020-04-05','2020-04-05','4.7','5.0','4.0','5.0','It is fairly on the easy side in

well structured step by step guidance this course is not right for you  Go somewhere cheaper or free and you will end up more satisfied  Also  some teachers use their hands so much and it is super distracting  please tell the teachers to minimize hand movements while instructing  Some code steps also get missed out without proper explanations by the teachers so if you already don t know about the topic or specific steps you will waste a lot of time trying to figure out why your screen is different to the teacher s screen because you think you have done something wrong when in fact the video missed some steps  They also have some technical issues with providing simple and easy to use in house workspace  Half of the time it didn t work so it was not worth using it at all  I also had an impression that mentors were just shuffled around to answer questions and repeated generic answers when some specific directions were needed  Overall  They say this is for intermediate coders  If it was the case maybe they should do a coding test first before accepting just anyone for a fixed amount of time  If you are not a professional full stack developer with decent few years of real world coding experience and you are a self taught developer with basic python skills  I wouldn t recommend this course  because there are too many unnecessary hurdles in between learning steps  When the

Developer Nanodegree from Udacity was really revolutionary step in my life  My story begins from exploring the world of mobile application development to understand smallest detail about developing an Android application  The course   was well developed and created by the ones who actually helped in making the android framework  The benefit of which was that they tells you really important parts of developing an Android application  Also another part of the course which i really like was that with learning about android development  there was 7 projects as well which can be challenging sometimes but gives you a real perspective and encouragement to imply whatever you have learnt from the course  This projects were time bound  which creates a push but in a good way  Whenever i submit the project  it gets reviewed by expert and I get great coding advice from the reviewers as well All of the projects have certain criteria to fulfill  without which the project won t be accepted  And whenever i have felt that there was some issues or i am getting stuck there were mentors provided by the Udacity who gives really amazing guidance and tips which helps really much Not only from the technological stand point  but Udacity focuses on overall development of the student  For example they provided some really good resources about do s and don ts for getting a job  how to prepare a good resume And lastly when the course is finished and i got a certification from udacity Now with all the pros there were some few cons as well For example when i joined the course  the course material was a old and not updated  although Udacity tries to keep it updated but some of the part of the course was old and the android framework was ahead of it  And some times communication was an

Android Development  I applied after 3 4 rounds of   interviews I got in  I couldn t believe myself  Before I joined college I had a vision that one day I ll be developing apps for mobile devices but had no means of guidance or support so this opportunity came in at just the right time  In India there s a neck to neck competition for everything thanks to the population  so I needed that extra push when I had to apply for Jobs  Internships  I was able to complete my Nanodegree under 12 months which usually costs over a Lac rupees which I wouldn t have been able to afford otherwise  In 12 months during my college I was already a good android developer  After which I worked for a startup in my third year and help them build an app that currently has over a million downloads on the Play Store  Since then I haven t looked back  I ve worked for various early stage startups  Udacity s Nanodegree in Android Development and Google gave me an opportunity for which I ll forever be indebt  I cannot thank them enough  It helped me kickstart my career as an Android Developer  Since then I ve learned a lot of new skills and technologies such as React Native etc  Currently I m working as a React

thought I would be an engineer  sincerely  I started FEND when I moved overseas with my family out of mere curiosity  9 month after I landed my first front end job and left public relations  So here are 5 main advantages of Udacity based on my   experience 1  Challenging assignments Most courses  especially free ones  offer assignments that are repetitive of the ones presented in the videos  It helps to retain the information but you need more than that  Udacity combines simple quizzes and typical interview tasks with really challenging projects that boost your creativity and make you more independent 2  Portfolio created by yourselfBy accomplishing the modules you also contribute to your own developer s portfolio  I even showcased my final project at a job interview and it was a deal breaker  So never be shy of showing what you have accomplished 3  Mentors and communityFEND is very challenging for beginners with no programming background  I m exactly this kind of person  so chances are high that you will get stuck  Here s when a mentor  help can come in handy  Mentors won t do your project for you but they will send you in the right direction  share resources and will help you review the code  Also  don t underestimate the help from your fellow students you can always get by reaching out to the community forums and Slack groups 4  A certificate that stands outWell  knowledge and pet projects can get you an interview  however  it s not bad to have some academic proof up your sleeve  Given that my major was linguistics and foreign languages  I mostly blame Udacity nanodegree for getting all my tech interview 5  Udacity helps with your careerUdacity cannot guarantee you will get the job but they will provide you with many resources and opportunities  I did not

content is not just recorded video lectures or voice over slides  they have quizzes  labs  a mix of content  text  video  visualization  and link to other resources  They are one of the few MOOC producers who hired professionals  designers  to create high quality visualizations to support the content  The only other one I m aware of is TeamTreeHouse  The nano degrees are designed around projects  project based learning  The projects are  usually  good and you get to learn a lot by working through them  They are innovating in the MOOC arena  two of their bests initiatives are hiring

it s expensive   very expensive   that is the nano degrees otherwise the courses are free  there is just a single model for the nano degrees   you must pay the whole fee and you get like several

specialization and it is always yours as long as they run the course   they are not entirely honest about the prerequisite I guess because they want to attract a greater audience  e g  the nano degree on React is not really designed for people who have not done web dev for example  the free content  courses  are left outdated on their own  There is almost no support  you cannot even find the assignments let alone get feedback on your work    You can get good reviews but you can get really BS reviews too  although you can always ask for regrade    They are pushing too hard to open new nano

was just a survey of the technology  They did not release Module 3  or 4  when it was supposed to be released  took them like 20 days and it become available like 5 days before its project was due  I dropped out of it and didn t get a refund  Sometimes they do wired things  like they send me an email to review Udacity here and then there are only options for two courses which I ve not taken either

adopting new courses to keep up with the ever evolving world of technology  My negative experiences sometimes are that courses skip too much information   that should be deemed important  I understand that sometimes including everything in a concise course is difficult and topics might be briefly reviewed  but I also noticed that some subjects should be expanded more upon to build a stronger foundation  experienced this during the early versions of Deep Learning My other concerns is the increasing pricing of the courses  I remember I only had to pay  200 for an entire course  which I was more than happy to do  Right now  courses can go over the 4 figures  which might limit some people  Udacity was built under the hope and idea to make learning and these materials easily accessible to people that might not have the resources to take them in a normal class setting One last comment  Udacity might have been a victim of it too  but when the Deep Learning project first came out  they were promoting the courses of a certain individual who has been found guilty of divulging wrong information and in legal trouble for bad practices  I like the idea to bring professionals into the courses  but YouTube sensations might not be the best suited person to teach a whole course  A better vetting process should be in place  we are students and we will believe all the information at face level  I found many times  that something was incorrect and spent too much time trying to figure out why I was wrong since my output was not the same  In the end  I found out that I was right all

asked me to rate my mentor  I rated four star  one star and left my comments  that was supposed to remain anonymous according to udacity  but by then the mentor changed behavior and he cancelled

hope it helps you to decide on whether you want to attend it  So let s start from plus sides  I learned how to make several apps on Android   from the scratch and the program constructed in a way that you have to make a big part of an app by yourself and your own design which makes it more interesting to learn  Another plus side is that actually videos are short which compared to long 2 hours boring videos does not make you fall asleep  All the way through course you have support of your mentor  peers and people who review apps and yes you will have to submit several during the course  Switching to the downsides  as for a working professional it was sometimes a bit hard to keep up with the course  because it has a timeline  At the same time it was also an upside as it makes you to learn all the time and not being lazy as you have to meet deadlines  Also  because it is a beginner course you might be not fully ready to be a working professional  additional learning is required

out to GA after extensive research while I was still employed at my finance job  I was impressed right off the bat with my admissions rep not being pushy or salesy   and gave me space to decide whether I really liked coding before quitting my job and enrolling  He was incredibly helpful throughout my decision to quit and enroll  Does it teach you the skills needed to be employable at graduation  Yes  My personal experience coming from a 0 coding background  I did some freecodecamp lessons to prepare as recommended by GA admissions but that was it  was that GA makes it incredibly feasible to learn full stack development  IF you complete everything they tell you  It is no secret that you get what you put into it  For 3 months you will not have a life  The amount of hours you put in is way more than just the 40 that your are in class  I probably came out around 75 hours a week with homework  labs and projects  You really will not be able to see family friends during this time  However  the way my cohort was set up  I believe this is a GA wide  was you technically only had to complete 80  of all homework and assignments  plus 4 big projects  I completed 100  of all the assignments and tried on all bonuses  I treated every homework like a project to turn over to a client  If you are paying this much money and signing up to truly change your career and get employed quickly then you need to be prepared to give it your all  I did see other students in my cohort struggle with turning things in and it shows in their job hunt after the fact  some still not employed  Your life will be nonexistent for 3 months but it is a worth it  Is there enough support from GA instruction  In my case  yes  But take that with a grain of salt  I happened to be in a cohort which started out with  11 students  but by the end there were only 7 of us  Again  don t underestimate the difficulty  with 2 instructors and a TA so I had ample support  My instructors were so knowledgeable and could solve any coding problem it seemed  I lucked out with quality instructors  The quality of instruction can vary based on your cohort  We had TA sessions I think 3 times a week where our TA would help you finish any assignment you were stuck on  Since there were so few of us we really got tailored support  I have heard other cohorts now are much larger   some 35 students with the same number of instructors  TAs so you may want to ask about your cohort size  it makes a huge difference  I guess I got lucky  But I tried to solve things on my own before going to instructors and TAs though  google will be your best friend and if you only rely on instructors to do your work for you or solve your problems  it won t do your any good in the long run  Is the career after graduation support good  Yes  They stay with you until you find a job  No joke  I couldn t believe that I still had GA s support after graduation  Right when I graduated I felt a little bit of an existential crisis  what do I do now  how to structure my day to job hunt  It was so nice to have a dedicated career coach to keep me on track and at least help with my materials  resume  portfolio  cover letters  I didn t end up leaning on GA too much for interview prep but they do offer that among so many other career services  I put a ton of work into my resume  portfolio  and LinkedIn  Because I worked hard during the bootcamp  I had ample portfolio pieces to add  I ended up applying to only around  25 jobs  I got a call back on around  5 of those  and ended up with 2 offers in the same week for software engineer positions  My current role is a full stack developer  Total job search was around 2 months  Some may look at me as the best case scenario  but I also took the time and

these technical skills in your pocket  you instantly become desirable to companies  One of the best things about this program is that you come out of it with four completely fleshed out projects  From planning to coding  fixing bugs  and writing the documentation  these projects not only improve your skills  but look amazing in your portfolio  The person who hired me at my current company told me

best of all is the Outcomes Team  They act as career coaches  taking your technical skills and teaching you how to apply what hiring managers are looking for in order to market yourself and network in

everything in 12 weeks  You should go into this knowing that you re going to pull all nighters  cry  and become frustrated but you have tons of support and   resources available to you  so take advantage of it  I enjoyed GA s course  I feel like we learned all of the things that we d want to learn from an instructor and not on our own  This is an incredibly fast paced class  I was in the remote program due to COVID  and my course was M F  9 5  The work doesn t stop at 5  Expect your 40 hour week to actually be 80  PROS  You ll be exposed to in demand technologies  languages  and frameworks such as JavaScript  React  and Python  My class had 2 instructors and 2 instructor associates  We also had 2 TAs who spent their evenings with us for help 7 days a week  Everyone is incredibly supportive and knowledgeable  I never felt intimidated asking for help  You ll also have career support after the program ends  We had 4 projects to help build out our portfolio  One project was a group project  so I was able to work on a team and get that experience which is obviously useful in the real world unless you re working for yourself  You ll come out of the program as a full stack engineer  and don t let anyone else tell you otherwise  CONS  This is a 12 week course  so you re not going to be job ready at the end  You re going to learn just enough to be able to continue learning the rest on your own  You ve got to make extra time to practice  and you re going to get burnt out  This is a BOOTCAMP  I felt that the curriculum could ve been structured a bit better  We hardly spent any time learning data structures and algorithms  which is the main thing that you need to ace during a technical interview  We only spent 1 week learning React  which is unfortunate since it s the most in demand library in the industry  We also never went over hooks  functional components  or Redux  We only spent  1 week learning Python again very unfortunate since that s in demand as well  I don t feel comfortable having Python as a language on my resume at this point  You ll want to blame the instructors  but please don t they re doing what GA is telling them what to do  We also only had one mock technical interview it would ve been great to have more since that s very intimidating for new engineers  There wasn t really any focus on CSS frameworks  so you ll need to learn those on your own  GA reuses their course notes  which is expected  but many times they weren t updated  Generally speaking  it wasn t a huge deal until we got to PostgreSQL  You re encouraged to code along during lecture  muscle memory works  however  it s very fast paced  so you re going to fall behind at some point  but that s what the notes are for  It was very frustrating when we were learning PostgreSQL  because our notes referenced SQLite  This was crammed into the week that we learned Python  so it was an absolute nightmare  The instructors even told us not to refer to the notes for PostgreSQL since the notes were wrong  It can t be that difficult to update the notes  right  When you graduate from this course  you ll be ready to apply for an internship  apprenticeship  or junior level role  If you re in this because you think you re gonna make bank after 12 weeks  you should get on Glassdoor and check the salaries in your area for junior level engineers  This isn t necessarily a con because you have to start somewhere  but just know that going into it  I wanted to review their Outcomes program separately  Outcomes is GA s career support  and you ll be paired with a career coach  It was frustrating to attend the Outcomes class during the week and especially during project weeks  I wish the program would ve been voluntary up until you graduate  The program is awesome and super beneficial to folks who have little to no job experience  You ll learn how to craft a resume and build out your brand  and you ll learn best practices for using LinkedIn and networking  However  if you ve been working professionally for some time  you ll find this frustrating because you ve likely been doing that already  That being said  once you graduate  the Outcomes program is so super incredibly helpful  You ve got to meet certain criteria to remain in the program  Expect to spend around 20 hours a week applying for jobs  You ll also be expected to attend networking events  This is all up to you  You re not going to get handed anything  but you ll be coached and given the tools you need to be successful  You ll also have access to GA s direct job recommendation process  Essentially  they ve got a Partnerships team that literally acts as a Sales Team to find open roles for GA grads  If you meet the criteria for one  you can actually get a written recommendation for it  I know that I listed a ton of cons  but overall  it was a really great experience  I d definitely recommend GA to anyone looking to make a career change  You can t do this by yourself  Just know that you have to continue doing the work after class ends  You ve got to make time to practice during the week  and you can forget about self care  But  you re going to have an amazing and supportive group of folks including the instructors  TAs  career coaches  and your entire cohort  You reap what you sow  To answer the burning question that you likely have it took me 23 days to find a job as a full stack web developer at a great company  I applied for 38 jobs  had 3 interviews  and had one offer  The offer that I accepted had a great starting salary for where I live  NYC it was more than what I expected and an awesome benefits package  I was very strategic about my job search  and for this particular job  I actually met all of the requirements because I had engineering experience prior to GA  For some folks  it might take a year to find a role  and that depends on tons of factors that GA may not even have control over such as

a pro and a con sometimes for me because the program is 12 weeks long and the units are only 3 weeks each  Just when you get comfortable with the instructor s teaching style  you are whisked away into the next unit with a new instructor  This can be a positive if you don t really like a particular instructor or are struggling with the teaching style  but it can also be negative since it can be jarring to switch up so quickly  Overall  the program is intense  I m sure you ve read many other reviews that say this because it s true  It can definitely get overwhelming  especially if you have little to no experience with coding programming before entering the program  You can easily bet on having 10  hour days at least 5 days week  What s nice is that you usually get a little bit of a break during the weekend because Friday s homework USUALLY isn t due until Sunday of that week  so you can take a weekend day off if you need want  Ultimately  you get what you put into the program  I mentioned before that it can be very overwhelming to learn new languages in general  but especially if you don t have any background coding experience exposure  That being said  there were quite a few of my classmates that had very little prior experience with coding that did extremely well  If you re hungry to learn and truly invest yourself in this bootcamp  I believe you will have a positive experience  This is definitely not an easy program  you will have to put in the work  but if you do  it will be worth it  About job support  each cohort has a dedicated career coach which you meet with  as a group  multiple times throughout the program  Your career coach creates interactive presentations on various topics regarding the job search such as  building your personal brand  tips for your portfolio website  etc  If you qualify for Outcomes  which is GA s program for job seekers  you are given additional support such as more meetings workshops with your career coach and additional slack channels for job seekers where jobs are posted multiple times per day  often from companies who have hired GA grads before  I had a very positive experience with GA s Software Engineering Immersive program and truly believe that anyone from any background can be successful if you work hard  stay positive  and keep a growth mindset'),(2268,7,92,'Jennifer

expect  When you google bootcamp reviews the results coming back tend to be all over the place from reviews that are very bad to reviews   that are nothing but outstanding  Through my experience  I ll provide an unbiased review highlighting the aspects I enjoyed and what I think needs improvement  General Assembly wasn t the first school I reached out to and in fact I had a very poor experience speaking with the admissions department at a GA competitor who didn t want to give me more than 20 her time  Speaking with Zack in admissions from GA was a completely different experience in the best way possible  Zack took his time answering all my questions to ensure I was making the correct decision  He was in constant communication with me throughout the entire application process so that there was no question as to what happened next  One thing to note is that General Assembly offers the choice learning Ruby Ruby on Rails or Python as the backend language and framework  I was speaking to a few of my classmates a couple weeks into the program and they didn t realize they had the option of learning a different backend because no one mentioned it  The class pre work was well written and the program they use was quite good however  I don t feel like the pre work prepared me for the class in any way  shape  or form  I feel like the pre work is written for someone who has previous experience with HTML  CSS  and JavaScript  rather than who s learning about it for the first time  Now the teaching platform used is extremely well written and easy to use but I think the prep should have been based more on the foundations and fundamentals of HTML  CSS  and JavaScript  The Software Engineering Immersive Remote course is a full stack software engineering program that teaches the MERN stack and the course is broke up into 5 units  Everything is taught by two main instructors and two instructor assistants  Coursework is heavy and moves at a very fast pace  Class is a mix of lectures  code along  and lab but the lecture isn t the boring type like you might think  The amount of information you take in on a daily basis and the amount of information you re expected to retain is probably more than you re used to  It wasn t till half way through my first project that I actually felt like I knew what was going on and I felt like I was trying to keep up with everything till that point  You re going to have days and weeks where you feel like you can t keep your head above water  I constantly felt behind  And before you know it  you re turning in the final project  Instructor assistants were quite helpful after school and on the weekends when they host office hours  My instructors helped when they could but both taught multiple classes each day  My instructors both referenced their real life work experience with what they were teaching and that was awesome to know  Now for what I think can be improved  First and foremost the pre work should be focused towards fundamentals and foundation building  I would add an additional week to the first four units  extending the course by an entire month  This would slow the pace of the course down enough to where retaining information learned becomes much easier and the student will be more comfortable with what they re learning  I had two great instructors but they were vastly different in how they approached teaching and some days I feel like they didn t know what the other instructor taught the previous day  Communication could have been better between the instructors  The full stack course does teach the backend but it s definitely front end heavy  At this point  I wouldn t hesitate to take a job as a frontend or full stack developer however  I wouldn t be confident taking a job as a backend developer after taking this course  Outcomes is what General Assembly calls their career support so far it s been quite helpful  They offer mock interviews  Linked In  and resume building  I ve only been with outcomes for a couple weeks but they ve been quite helpful so far  Overall I had a solid experience and learned a TON of information in a short amount of time  I wouldn t hesitate to take another course through General Assembly in the future and honestly  I may go take the UX UI course down the

learned skills that will benefit me in my career change  It s been 10 months since I ve graduated and I still do not have a job  The timing of when I finished   school  right at the start of COVID  definitely affected employment  but I do feel like administration was a little misleading when it came to how soon I could expect to find work and gave somewhat unrealistic expectations about that process  I think they told me the average student is employed within 3 months of graduation  The payment program is helpful through and it is nice to know that I don t have to pay anything back until I am employed full time  The instructors are great and the material is relevant to the more useful skills to know in the real world  I got to attend in person for half of the time and the facility was nice  I enjoyed the pace of the course and felt like it was hard but not too overwhelming and I had a lot of support both during class time and outside of class from the instructors  I never felt that I couldn t ask a question or get further clarification about something  I wish I had more support during the course with preparing for after graduation  I felt like there was not enough time spent on the job seeking side of things  It would have been helpful to have more direct support from career coaches  help with portfolios  and other job seeking materials  I also found there were much better methods of doing some of the things I learned that I wished had been implemented in class  I think there were some concepts skills that were taught in class in a way that was easier to understand  but not necessarily the best way to do them'),(2275,7,92,'Anonymous','True',2021,'False','2021-02-19','2021-02-19','3.7','4.0','4.0','3.0','What background in coding did you have prior to the course    I came into my course having already coded a decent amount in my life  It was all hobby based  but I felt pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS  as well as the basics of JavaScript  At   the behest of some friends who were already software engineers  I also followed the advice I mentioned above  and tried to take advantage of AS MUCH free learning as I absolutely could  So for probably 2 3 months before I even enrolled in my Bootcamp  I took advantage of some sales on Udemy and bought some Stephen Grider React courses and learned as much as I could about the MERN Stack  MERN meaning MongoDB  your document database  Express js  your Node js web framework  React js  your client side JavaScript framework  and Node js  essentially your JavaScript server  If I had time  I would have loved to have learned even more beforehand  Two main reasons for all of this  1  you get to test the waters and see if you even enjoy being neck deep in a text editor writing code  It s not for everyone and that s okay  2  and just as importantly  Most modern coding languages are just off shoots of other languages  Many  many  many front end languages are built on top of JavaScript HTML CSS  So  having a really solid fundamental understanding of these languages will do nothing but make learning the more difficult languages concepts frameworks THAT much easier  I personally don t feel that it is possible to over prepare for something like a bootcamp for these specific reasons   Has the instruction been thorough or are you googling a lot  Slightly loaded question  I have LOVED my instructors  Incredibly knowledgable  empathetic  caring people who have bent over backwards to make sure that as many of the students in my cohort are equipped to succeed in a professional SE role post bootcamp  The class moved kinda slowly at first  but picked up speed VERY quickly  The communicated goal was to teach us the 20  we would need to know in order to accomplish 80  of the work we would be doing  All of that to say that they  inherently  can only teach us so much in  13 weeks  Thus  a huge focus quickly became teaching us how 1  ask the RIGHT questions and 2  how to scour Google or StackOverflow or wherever for answers  So  Both  The two core instructors for our cohort are very thorough  but a skill of being an effective software engineer is ultimately just problem solving  so you ll definitely have plenty of situations where Googling a particular error or what have you is a must  Again  just part and parcel of being a developer   What material haven t you get that you wish you had  not sure if you have a sense of that yet  Not sure I have a great answer for this one  but there are definitely things that I had to put time toward myself because we just patently did not cover them in class  Immediate things that come to mind are the core computer science pillars of data structures  algorithms  design patterns  and code testing  We touch on each of the above in class  but I was not prepared for any of these appearing in technical interviews based on class  GA could definitely do a better job here  but 1  there admittedly just isn t enough time in 13 weeks of class and 2  they did point me at resources  I just had to tackle them in my own time   Why d you choose this program over other programs  Languages  I spoke to a lot of friends who were Software Engineers already  before I ever even really truly considered enrolling  They pretty much all told me the same thing  focus on what languages they re teaching and how they support you on the job front  GA is pretty solid on both fronts I d say  Their tech stack is ultimately what pulled me in  we started with HTML CSS JavaScript to learn front end development  then moved to full stack and learned MongoDB  Express  Node js  and others  then focused on drilling down into front end frameworks such as React  then finally learned API driven development and kinda tying it all together  learning Ruby  Ruby on Rails  SQL  and how to make those work nicely with our frontends  Their Get You Hired Team  GA calls this  Outcomes  which I d say has been a little lackluster  but most of my issues with it could be tied to the fact that the entire team for my cohort is based out of DC  So they re all crazy knowledgable  but I don t know  There s only so much they can do from a distance and during a global pandemic  For reference  I also seriously considered HackReactor  Flatiron School  and Turing School   What have been the best and the worst things about the experience  The best has been discovering a new love and passion  honestly  I absolutely adore what I do at this point  but BOY was it tough  Like  anyone considering a bootcamp just needs to be really  really honest with themselves and set realistic expectations  You are trying to learn an entirely new career field in 13 weeks   IT IS NOT EASY  There is an OBSCENE amount of information   and often incredibly dense  convoluted information at that  Once again  it IS NOT EASY  I drive that point only because we 100  lost multiple people from our cohort because it was just a lot more than they were expecting  A totally normal day for me was to be in class from 8am to 4pm  with breaks here and there   a longer break for lunch  take a power nap immediately after  and then grind on homework for 4 or more hours  That time is important too  because your homework is really your only chance to practice  and if you re not practicing every day to some degree  you re just making it harder on yourself  Then there was probably longer homework for the weekend  or a project  or whatever  Just wanting to be totally clear  I ate  slept  and breathed code because that s kinda what it takes to make it through a bootcamp like this  again  just my opinion   What kind of time are you putting in outside of class  Not to be a broken record  but this will require a huge amount of time  I spent 500  hours just IN CLASS over my 3 ish months  With homework  there was generally the expectation that you would put at LEAST 4 hours toward it  If you got it done  awesome  if not  you should probably get sleep rather than throwing more than 4 hours at homework  We also had 5 ish  projects  over the course of the class  I couldn t even begin to estimate the time I sunk into those  but we generally had 1 week of self led work time to finish each of those  So  ideally  you really want to have a deep interest in coding and the technologies at play with whatever you re building  Otherwise  it just becomes difficult to stay motivated  Again  just my  02   Are things working out with the fully remote covid plan  Are teachers accessible and approachable    Best as can be expected  I think  I would have preferred to be in person  but remote learning hasn t been nearly as drastically different as I kind of expected  You meet in your Zoom classroom everyday  anyone everyone is only a Slack message away  my instructors were both always really good about hosting regular office hours   responding to random requests for help or insight  I also was still able to make a bunch of friends which I would 1000  recommend  The people in your cohort are quite literally the only one s who will understand the depth of what you re going through  It s an experience that really brings people together  in my opinion  There are people I will most definitely keep in contact with after the Bootcamp  Hopefully the above wasn t too much or too overwhelming  I am 1000  a proponent of a bootcamp like GA offers  I just think everyone should know that it is  unavoidably  a massive undertaking  But you will get out what you put in'),(2276,7,92,'Anonymous','True',2019,'False','2021-02-17','2021-02-17','3.3','3.0','4.0','3.0','I was a little

was largely left to my own devices to try and figure it all out  The SEI program at General Assembly was a world apart  Though more narrowly focused than a general coding course or comp sci degree  we were shown all of the different parts we would be working with  how they fit together  and used what we learned to make smaller scale versions of real world applications  I had the unenviable position of being right in the middle of my course when COVID hit and we had to transition on the spot from an in person course to an online only  Though less than ideal for my particular learning style  the classes were still handled admirably and taught as well as they could be for such a drastic shift for everyone involved  Since online only versions of the courses already existed  the transition

to learning new concepts and practice implementing those concepts  and the third week being project week  The first unit was basic HTML  CSS  and JavaScript  and it was a lot of information but it was pretty straight forward  I already knew some of the content going in so this part was mostly a breeze for me  The second unit  however  is make or break  It was hard  it was too much content packed into a short amount of time and it made a lot of people frustrated and made some people almost give up  And while I will be honest and say that I definitely think that unit needs to be restructured and the content should be stretched out a little  I also figured it out with grit and determination  As others have already stated  this course is extremely fast paced and so it takes a certain kind of person  Which is partly why I say it s not right for everyone  But if you re a hard worker and you re determined  it s possible  After the second unit  it all pretty much got easier and I think we all started to feel like we knew what we were doing  despite being only 6 weeks in  Culture  I do want to call attention to the fact that GA did a pretty good job of feeling inclusive and welcoming  Everyone is asked to share their pronouns up front  which is something I appreciate as a non binary person  My cohort was very diverse  we had some Latin American students  some older students  black students  LGBT students and women  Overall  the culture was relatively laid back  most people were pretty friendly and encouraging  and I really loved GA s philosophy about growth mindset  Instructors  Some people have mentioned that bootcamp instructors are often recent graduates of the bootcamp  and that this leads to a lower quality of education  I can t speak for other bootcamps  but all of my instructors were smart and knowledgeable people  and the ones who were recent graduates of the program were teaching assistants whereas our lead instructor had some experience working as a software developer at multiple companies before coming back to teach  Overall  I have a lot of respect and admiration for my instructors  Career support  Overall  the career support is fantastic and our career coach is a goldmine of useful advice  One minor complaint is that we had to go to career classes every week as part of our normal schedule  and this sometimes applied during project weeks where it was hard to pay attention because I had a tight deadline and just wanted to work on my project  However  I am genuinely amazed at how far I ve come and how much more confident I am in applying to jobs as a software developer  I am someone who has always loathed and dreaded the job search process and finds it all to be extremely stressful  highly scripted and daunting  so for me to have come this far says a lot  I feel more confident in my salary negotiation abilities  my resume writing abilities  everything is just laid out in a way that makes a ton of sense  Overall  bootcamp may or may not be the best route to becoming a software developer depending on your personal preferences  but it was a great choice for me and it has been totally life changing  I don t regret it at

not a school and not a university  They are a for profit company whose goal above all else is that keep you from dropping out so that they can collect   and cash your tuition checks  And to achieve that goal  they will tell you pretty much anything before and during the course  You will be exposed to everything in the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp  multiple coding languages  multiple frameworks  front end   back end  but you will not master any of these things  you will not be good at any of these things  you wont even be competent at any of these things by the time you finish the bootcamp  I would say that at the completion of the GA Software Engineering Immersive you are 60  of the way to the starting line of being able to apply for jobs  You are looking at a MINIMUM of 6 months of work on your own  after you finish the bootcamp  before you are ready to apply for dev jobs  I had 14 students in my bootcamp and 12 months after finishing  1 had a job  And that 1 developer had previously worked doing HTML   CSS  so he had experience  and the job that landed was doing more HTML   CSS DO NOT believe the graduation and job placements stats that they tell you  They do everything that they possibly can to disqualify you from  graduating  so that they don t have to count you in their job placement statistics  If you are 1 minute late to class more than 3 times over the 3 month bootcamp  you don t  graduate  and you don t get counted in the job placement states  After finishing the bootcamp  if you miss a class with the career services people  you don t graduate  If you don t finish a single homework on time  you don t graduate  Out of the 14 students in my bootcamp  3 ended up  graduating  even though we all finished the course  we were there on the last day  did all the projects  and finished all the homework  GA s graduation statistics are a farce and they do everything they can to juice those stats  Oh and if you don t  graduate  the career development department will smile as they refuse to lift a finger to help you get a job  After paying  15k for the bootcamp  For the course itself  you get exposed to lots of development principles  and lots of areas of development  The instructors are competent but they also refuse to answer most questions under the guise that  you learn better if you figure it out yourself  Yeah that gets frustrating when you are paying  15k for their instruction  At the end of the bootcamp and after paying  15k  you will be months of work away from being able to apply for a job  you wont have any of the skills to be able to build anything on your own  you likely will have zero support from career services  and you will feel like you got scammed  I regret taking General Assembly s Software Engineering

because the course for me was just teachers and all running around like chickens with there heads cut off Pros    You meet other classmates doing the same thing  Cons  Very little support  No real hiring potential by going through GA vs anywhere else  Like other students got a job at said company and the employers thought it was a great hire and would love to hire more GA graduates  thats not really much of a thing  Teachers don t answers questions   big one in my opinion because I joined the bootcamp to learn and understand what s going on not just be some attack dog that can only do what s in front of them  Recordings of the class were all deleted two months after the course when they explicitly said they would up for 6 months  All the teachers are burnouts from other parts of the industry and it s not a good atmosphere  Constant surveys you have to fill out for them  2 3  a day sometimes  The class is only really 9 weeks long because 3 of those weeks are taken off to work on your own and make a project  were you get almost no help  Costs 15k  Job support is pretty much non existent unless your have a specific question  They say they don t do grades  but they do  They grade all your stuff like 9 out of 10 etc  and even one day in class a girl was having loads of problems with what we were going over so she asked for help and the teacher was just like na I have to go grade projects  Also the teachers are late a lot  have babies in class etc   this was almost an everyday thing and maybe they re just not paying there employees enough if they can t afford

students asked too many questions or were challenging  But would often say  please ask me questions so you can make the most out of your money  During one full week project  the teachers wouldn t even come on zoom calls to help us debug our code and told us off again for not asking for help  The last module   Python  Django and PostgreSQL should be omitted from the programme as it only reflects how well students can copy and paste code to fulfil a project with a backend in a different language  They clearly only do this to bulk out their technologies and languages taught during the course  The teacher barely even knew Python and was googling most the answers  Some students were even correcting them  Otherwise  surely they should get a data science instructor to each us fundamentals in Python  General Assembly s excuse to that is by week 10 there s no shame in googling for the answer as that s also industry standard  And I completely agree  but at  9 000 you would expect the tutor to be knowledgable in that language Another massive joke is that we had to deploy two of our big projects by ourselves with absolute MINIMAL help  After the course finished Herkou was no longer supporting the backend to one of our projects  We ve not heard from the instructor how to redeploy  This proves that once you ve finished there s no support  How can they charge  9000 and not help

that I never would have gotten as far as I have without the support of their truly incredible staff  The instructors have such a breadth   of knowledge and are very talented at building up that knowledge in others  taking it step by step  crafting the curriculum in a way where each step really builds upon the last  My class in particular was also somewhat split in skill level  with some people coming in with prior experience  others complete beginners  a huge variety in skills preferences  etc  and they still did incredible job engaging each and every one of us  It was practically seamless  And all of us graduated having learned so much and reaching major achievements in our applications projects Additionally  the thing that really made my decision to go there in the first place   is the  Outcomes  team  ie the career support  They are without  a  doubt  the most active  supportive  and knowledgable career support services I ve ever worked with  I was kind of skeptical at first  thinking they d just kind run over resumes or something and send you off  But they are so hands on and individualized  My career advisor at GA has gotten to know so much about my background and career goals  details that even my family forgets  and has such an in depth knowledge base of the job market  and networking  linked in  portfolios  skill building  ALL of it  They work with you after the program too Also notable is that my class in particular was interrupted by the coronavirus crisis and I just have to say   as someone who doesn t usually learn well online and was very nervous about having to transition remote   is that they handled the crisis perfectly  They did intense research to understand the situation factually as it developed  communicated clearly kindly and continuously with everyone  and both as a group and individually supported us through the whole process  the student experience head even took the time to sit down with me personally to talk through what was happening and even just how I felt about it  and seemed really genuinely glad to do so  It was an unprecedented  difficult situation for everyone   but they handled it so well  I can t compliment them enough on it Cons  My only  only  reservation with this program is that the instructional team isn t very diverse  The only instructor of color was hired half way through my course  so we never had class with him directly  and our entire instructional team was men  I know that they are fierce advocates for diversity in tech   they offer scholarships to that effect and actually actively speak up against problematic things  it s also the first non LGBT specific place I ve ever known to share pronouns freely comfortably  but the lack of representation in the technical team did give me pause at first  I do know that that is a criticism for the tech sector in general though  and I hope to see them grow in this way in the near

well stocked with excellent Frontlines support  I would give it as near as 100  as possible  Classrooms always have working projectors  enough seats and whiteboards  Coffee  Peanut Butter and Jelly and tea bags are always plentiful OutcomesThe outcomes team gives the students most of the skills I learned in this industry at dozens of customers and clients over 20 plus years  As much as the students complained about the long sessions to me  those that follow its rigors will secure a position quickly CurriculaThe curricula as defined in the GA SEI Syllabus compares well with Flatiron  CodingDojo  Trilogy and others InstructionAll lead instructors seemed knowledgeable of the material covered  All instructors were approachable and inviting of the material DeliveryThe Google calendar was updated weekly with relatively accurate material to be presented and learned  Labs and software functioned as expected  Installfest saved the students trouble that they will quickly learn in the field  Compatibility and libraries are key from development to deployment MinusesNow  some constructive guidanceLocationThose stairs are extremely steep and elevator access restricted  Heat in these historical buildings often has trouble on those frosty days  This one is no different  a space heater or two might help if compliant ones are available OutcomesOnly one thing I might recommend here are interview dry runs  We had one or two examples of interviews  and I imagine hiring panel next week will be equally excellent  But as mentioned below  practice  practice practice  All candidates I have ever met benefit from practicing the interview questions and the discomfort  I mentor all of my charges in this area  We even do professional development sessions on it CurriculaThe curricula was not taught completely  For example  one of the reasons  that I  an experienced Engineer chose GA were the Algorithms and Data Structures courses as shown in the screenshots below These courses were not available until after the course opened and even worse were never addressed  This pattern of missing core material as we moved forward forms part of the basis for my letter and departure InstructionOur lead instructor changed three times  None of them covered all of the material separately or together  For new students this gap will carry over into their new careers  Although I mentioned this before and in tickets  it has not been addressed adequately  It cannot be rectified at this late stage  DeliveryFurthermore there was often a lack of respect for the difficulties that the students faced  Comments such as the students are  lazy   do not want to work  or  do not like to read have been heard  While I encourage constructive criticism it must be backed by instructional excellence Instructional ExcellenceAlthough very personable as a whole the instructional style was far too loose to give new students the comfort they need in this difficult  challenging and dynamic field  Like sport and music  training for novices is about learning patterns and executing them repeatedly and in combination  As the student grows  these patterns or katas inspire the artists to create their own symphonies Not enough structure was provided for training the students muscle or neurological pathways to allow for confident improvisation  This is my number one guidance  When teaching new material it is vital that it is taught  demonstrated  practiced and reviewed  Although much of the material had this character  it has not been consistent enough to train the students   On my final day I was directly criticized for the instructional failures of this cohort  I was told that I was pushing and telling the students what to do when in reality all that I did was Describe the concept Demonstrate the concept Allow the students to choose issues to tackle Reviewed them as a whole The instructor who arrived later to try to guide us was disrespectful to me and to the classroom in his behavior  SummaryI chose GA over the alternatives for several reasons  First  the curriculum met most of the baselines of each of the other bootcamps in the area  although it was slightly pricier  the vibe and location seemed worth it  I was 100  accurate on the location and vibe  you are a warm and welcoming team that open your hearts to all students Please structure the courses more  I mentioned this in my ongoing tickets and this letter  One of the lead instructors offers great answer and respond format  He sometimes made the students uncomfortable  yet it was the type of discomfort of growth rather than pain  Consistent training of your junior and lead instructors will ensure that the student learn the patterns better and all material is covered Overall I have learned much from this program  I attended to have a structure and milestones to meet in an immersive format  This need was met  I am glad that I took this program  but I wonder if the Trilogy program might be more structured  Regardless  I thank you for this opportunity and look forward to seeing any of you in the field Sincerely Gouthum

wholeheartedly loved my experience at GA  My experience was decidedly a good one  and I wouldn t hesitate to recommend General Assembly to someone   looking for an immersive  full stack bootcamp in Boston  The decision to switch careers  quit my job  and enroll in a bootcamp was not one I took lightly  and I spent almost a year researching before showing up to 125 Summer Street in September  Before taking the leap into a bootcamp  I set up more than a dozen informational interviews with alumni of various bootcamps  attended bootcamp info sessions  struggled through some self taught coding online  and read so many bootcamp reviews  Switchup proved to be an excellent source for me  so I decidedly wanted to write a review here once I had some time to reflect on the experience My background I went to university and studied linguistics  and then went to grad school for speech language pathology  I worked as a clinician in a hospital setting for  2 years  but wanted a different kind of challenge   more problem solving  more creative thinking  more building things  fixing things  making things work better  I also wanted the flexibility to work remotely and better opportunities for career advancement  A part of me just really missed being in a learning environment  and I wanted a career where I d always be wanting to learn something new that mattered for my daily work   Finding the right bootcamp  choosing between Launch Academy and GA Initially  I considered bootcamps nation wide  and was seriously interested in a few in the Bay Area  PNW  and NYC  However  I live in Cambridge  and wanted to leverage my existing network and support system here  Eventually  I narrowed my search to full time  immersive bootcamps located in Boston  I was seeking a bootcamp that was immersive  had a primarily technical curriculum  taught full stack web development  and had strong outcomes support  For Boston during my search  I distilled the options down to two main opportunities  Launch Academy and General Assembly  I met alumni from both of these bootcamps  talked with the admissions team from each  and visited both campuses  they re practically next door neighbors in downtown  I initially got really good impressions from both places  and I really connected with one of the co founders at Launch Academy  In fact  I had all but committed to enrolling at Launch  up to the point of putting down a deposit to secure my spot in the fall cohort  However  over the summer there were a few instances of communication breakdown where I wasn t hearing back from Launch  and after a few emails went unanswered I felt a little unsettled  After doing some deeper research online  I saw found a few other concerning signs  Launch had quietly cancelled plans to open an all female coding bootcamp in DC  and had more recently just closed their only other campus outside of Boston  which was in Philadelphia  General Assembly  on the other hand  had continued to have excellent communication  and the bottom line was that I started to have a better gut feeling about GA than Launch  So I got a refund from my deposit at Launch  which they were great about   no questions asked  and signed up for General Assembly instead  I should say here that I ve continued to keep up with folks from Launch Academy  and they give very good reviews of their experience  I also met a bunch of guys who were in the cohort I would have been at Launch when we were all about halfway through our respective bootcamps  and they raved about their experience  In the end  I think the fact that General Assembly is a much bigger organization and had better communication  read  an entire team focused on enrolling new students  made me feel more comfortable investing in my experience at GA  For what it s worth  GA s campus is also beautiful  which makes for a great first impression   Pre work for WDI Before starting the bootcamp  GA gives WDI students a set pre work which they say is  70 hours of work  The material was good  but was realistically more like 20 40 hours of work  While I thought it was a good foundation  we never received any meaningful feedback on our pre work  and it was almost never referenced during the immersive itself  The pre work was probably the least well executed part of the whole experience  I would say that it s worthwhile to do  but not to spend too much time energy on it  I got more out of some other free online options  like Harvard s CS50 class on edX org   During the bootcamp The program was split into 4 units  each of which culminated in a portfolio project  The units got slightly shorter as we progressed   more hands on in the beginning  more independent study towards the end  The first unit felt a bit slow  and the pace of the course is definitely modulated by how well the cohort as a whole is doing  There was always the option to slack message the instructor and request more advanced readings  additional problems  or more prompts for practice  My biggest take away from my experience with the actual content is that you get out what you put in   it s definitely possible to do the bare minimum during each day  complete the bootcamp  and essentially learn very little  On the other hand  the day s coursework gives you plenty to continue practicing after the day s instruction is over  More nights than not  I was spending 2 4 hours getting more practice  finishing the afternoon s lab assignment  trying the morning diagnostic again  or reading up on the next day s topic   People at GA Without question  what made my experience so great at GA was the quality of people that you get to interact with on a daily basis  The instructors are top notch   I can t say enough good things about the lead instructor  Mike F  The associate instructors each have their strengths  but across the board everyone cares and is willing to sit down with you and answer questions  or at least get back to you on slack  I never felt like my time wasn t respected by any of the instructors  The staff that keep GA humming  Frontlines  are also incredible   it was easy to become friends with the people I saw there every day  From offering vitamin C supplements when people were getting sick  to keeping the coffee fresh  to simply asking how my weekend was  Frontlines staff made me feel welcome in the space  Finally  the outcomes team  Julie and Kara  are phenomenal  They truly have excellent connections in the area  know the job market  and have their process ironed out to keep job seekers on track during and after the program   Things I loved about GA GA is a big company  but I was really happy to find that the Boston campus really has it s own personality  Community at GA Boston is huge   alumni regularly come back to give talks  participate in alumni panels  and even hire recent GA grads at the meet  amp  hire Like I mentioned earlier  the physical space that GA occupies is beautiful  Walking into 125 Summer Street every morning felt good  and the building is beautiful  The building also has a badge access bike cage and a really awesome shower facility  with day lockers  towel service  disposable razors  shaving cream  it was nicer than my shower at home  I biked to school every day so this ended up being a huge perk for me  GA provides some basic breakfast staples  coffee  tea  milk  cream  oatmeal  which made it so I could spend more time on campus  save some money on groceries  and maximize the time I could spend studying working coding  The physical space was open until 10pm most nights  which meant I could go to the gym after school  come back  and do all my work at school  which really worked for me  There were usually a few other classmates that stayed late with me  and the space is used by various meetups and night classes  so it doesn t feel desolate after hours   Things I didn t love about GA 1  I wish there had been more individualized feedback throughout the course  After my first project  I had a 1 1 with a pair of associate instructors to go over my project  I was really looking forward to getting some specific feedback  i e  this function could have been written in a better way  you could have made this a class  you could have structured your source code into a few different files  but instead I found out that no one had actually looked in depth at my code   the meeting was just meant to go over how I felt doing the project  and the code review was essentially checking to see if I met minimum requirements and had any user facing bugs  2  Over the entire bootcamp  there were only two times when office hours were offered after class  Each time  a handful of instructors  seemingly there on their own time  stayed around for about 30 minutes  were only able to help a handful of people  and then it was just the students in a room helping each other  3  The content was a little too pre programmed   there were several times when my classmates or I had a question that wasn t explicitly in the outline for that class lecture  and it was obvious that the instructors didn t want to go too far off script  with the exception of the lead instructor  This usually wasn t a problem because it was in the interest of keeping the course on schedule  but there were other times when we had the time but questions were deferred or just given non satisfying answers and then moved away from   Epilogue I don t think a coding bootcamp is for everyone  But if you ve found that a bootcamp is something you re 100  committed to  I think GA is a great place to take the leap  After the program  I ve connected with lots of other GA grads who are a few years into their careers as devs  and they have positions in companies that I would love to work for one day  and that s a great sign  I m a little over a month out of the bootcamp  and just accepted a full time job as a software engineer in Boston  which I m thrilled to start  If you have more questions  or want to chat over coffee  I m more than happy to pay it forward   find me on linkedIn at linkedin com in vmcasbarro'),(2343,7,92,'Arthur Bernier

school  and not full time employment  I still think I can offer some valuable feedback to the course  Pros Cohort was about 15 students  Strong collaborative culture  As students  we ate lunch together just about every day and enjoyed good conversation outside of the hard work we were doing We had two excellent instructors who struck a good balance between us learning how to solve our own

to learn  what questions to ask   I now feel like the only thing between me and conquering a new language or technology or project is the time invested to learn  Cons If I had to pick a con  I would

programming  I tried reading books they were usually out of date by the time I was trying to program against them and resulted in a lot of unnecessary and confusing bugs  I   tried signing up for free MOOCs and even paid online courses I always ended up dropping them after the first evening because I got busy with life and didn t have anyone holding me accountable  Finally  I found General Assembly   Denver  I had the desire to learn  but they expected me to show up every day and work hard to master this stuff  and it made all the difference  Thanks to 2 fantastic teachers who believed in me  got me excited about working in technology  and helped explain complex JavaScript and web framework concepts piece by piece  I mastered the basics of web development in only 3 months  One of the things I appreciated most about the web development course was the scope of the curriculum and how tightly it was aligned to the job search  Before GA  I kept switching around between C  and Python and other languages based on friend s recommendations  and never got any traction on any of them because I didn t know what employers were really looking for  GA is very focused on web languages and frameworks and there are a LOT of employers looking for those skills  I was surprised how many web development roles there were once I started looking  The other thing I really liked about GA s curriculum was the emphasis on projects  Sure  we had daily homework and lessons  but they were all aimed towards helping us succeed during the next project  And we could make whatever we wanted it was super exciting and motivating to have that level of freedom during school GA s  1 priority as a school is to help you land a job at the end  They talk about it when you apply  they talk about it every week during school  and you have constant access to a career coach during your job search  Before you graduate  you ve taken a professional headshot  targeted your resume  updated your LinkedIn profile  and developed a personal portfolio site that highlights your 4 projects from school  Those tools  combined with some additional networking  interviewing and negotiating salary sessions with my career coach  helped me land a fantastic first gig within 4 months of graduating  And it wasn t just me most of the people in my class landed jobs within 3 months of graduating  The only con I can think of is that Denver is a relatively new campus so they are still working out some of their processes  The good news is that gives you a lot of flexibility to pitch in as a student   I decided to put on a hackathon for alums and was able to make it happen  A more established program would probably have had a lot of red tape getting in the way of innovating like that  Also  even though GA s Denver campus is relatively new  they have the resources of GA generally and are working hard to develop the alumni community  I m still in touch with several people who graduated in my cohort  and not only are they good resources for networking and discussing issues we re facing in the industry  they have also become some of my good friends in

years and having failed to do so in my spare time I dropped everything and spent my savings to attend General Assembly s Web Development Immersive  The immersive nature of the course helped to make this a turning   point in my life  where I left behind a career that was comfortable for me  but less and less satisfying  Between classroom time and homework  I spent up to 80 hours a week learning the technology  I liken it to holding on for dear life to the rear of a speeding train  Every day  a new subject folded into the tools we were taught  I felt more uncomfortable than most  moving on before feeling I had a firm grasp on the subjects we d already covered  but that s the model  Maximum exposure  minimum depth  And it has proved true in the real world of tech that I m utilizing new tools constantly  and need to skim and integrate on the fly  The curriculum varied depending on the teachers  A second Web Development cohort that ran concurrent with ours had somewhat different scheduling and subjects covered  Since our cohort of around 24 students had 3 teachers  I d expected more individualized attention than what we got   Instead  it was an opportunity for the teachers to rotate lectures  Different teachers had different areas of expertise  and the lectures were excellent  We were often told that this was a pedagogical choice  with the constant refrain   Nobody will hold your hand in the real world  As a person who had spent many years in the  real world  I found this exasperating  I know that I m not learning unless I struggle  I also know when I m not learning because I need a push in the right direction  This was not the real world  It was an expensive one time opportunity to learn all I could in 12 weeks  Teacher interaction would be a thing that separated the experience from  say  online courses  In the same vein  we were provided a teacher s assistant for a few hours  4 nights a week  It was hard to take advantage of this  as the competition for the TA s attention was overwhelming  Overall  I m glad I did it  The curriculum was fine  the lectures were interesting  the environment was pleasant  and it served to give me a new direction  But

the most important decisions I ve made in my life  At the time  I was a tennis instructor  In my spare time  I played around with introductory Python  PHP  and JavaScript classes online  While these classes were enjoyable and   taught me some rudimentary concepts  I realized that I was not learning much in the way of solving more complex problems I feel very fortunate to have landed in my WDI cohort  Our instructors were wonderful at explaining the many concepts we learned during the course  and very supportive whenever we struggled with a problem  I also had a great class of very supportive and helpful students  We spent a lot of time working through assignments together  and learned a lot from one another  Three years later I still keep in contact with many of these people The outcomes class was very helpful in getting me prepared to hunt for work in a job market that was completely foreign to me  I felt confident that I would know what to do throughout the job searching process  and managed to find work as a full stack developer approximately 3 months later On the topic of jobs  GA could have done a little bit more to put us in contact with potential employers and recruiters  Also  support after the class was over was pretty minimal  Having access to the GA space was really nice  but we were not supported much beyond that  I believe the mentorship program that was launched after my graduation is attempting to address these issues At the end of the day  I think that students will get out what they put in  My class was made up of very focused  determined  and hard working people  Pretty much everyone found work as developers within 3 4 months of completing the course  I d certainly recommend GA as a place to go if you re ready for a career

and video for around 12 years  I also had some experience with some very basic HTML and CSS but that s about it  When I started in   January I was very nervous and excited and hopeful  I graduated yesterday and I still feel the same way  What an awesome experience  Over the course of the 3 months I was at General Assembly  I had four main instructors  Jamie King  Daniel  James and Blake  They all were such a big help in my growth and exploration of Web Development  Overall  the course was a lot of fun  It was extremely stressful and challenging at times  but I stuck with it  and pulled many late nights and early mornings  One thing I want to make perfectly clear to you  Bootcamps BEGIN your journey  Upon graduation  you are going to have a firm understanding of how you learn  how best you study and you will also have a solid understanding of the things you chose to excel at  If you do the bare minimum you will not get anything out of the bootcamp experience  I know what my weaknesses are now and I know my strengths and my next step now is to continue working on my weaknesses  create assignments and goals for myself  and I am going to continue studying the WDI14 curriculum until I have a solid understanding of everything  Another piece of advice I have  Study like your job depends on it  it does  and the WD interview questions are extremely technical so you NEED TO HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING  Also  start job hunting really early  Most corporations or grown up jobs not only perform extensive background checks which can take a month or longer  they also check references etc  Do NOT wait until the last minute  Start hunting a few weeks into the program  So there are the positives  The negatives  Outcomes could be much stronger  more structured  and hold mock interviews etc  I felt like the outcomes portion was a little weak  A lot of it was optional  and it seemed targeted to absolute beginners  I felt like I knew all the information  so there should be advanced and beginners outcomes for the different walks of life that come into the program  I also felt like my determination was not recognized by the outcomes coach  We butted heads on perspectives as I didn t believe in waiting until the last minute to job hunt  And who was right in the end  I got an offer letter the same day I graduated  so I think I did something right  Many people laughed at me for job hunting early  but I wish the best of luck to them as they wake up today unemployed  Another thing is the speed  I think the WDI would have been better if perhaps one or two less complex subjects were set aside for more time spent going over the very complex subjects  They try to pack a ton of subjects into the lesson plans and that ends up creating lecture plans that are rushed  Sometimes the speed was completely disorienting and overwhelming  It was actually completely ridiculous in many cases  but I figured out how to deal with it  I will spend the next few months going over and over the lessons until I really understand the complex subjects  for instance  State and Props in React is something I STILL struggle with  I wish more time was spent on it  Overall  I really really really enjoyed GA  I had an amazing  life changing experience  I would recommend to to anyone who is dead serious about starting a career in Web Development  If you are serious about working very hard for three months  seven days a week  then sign up  If you are serious about education and self improvement then sign up  If you aren t decided on what you want to do  pause and research more until you know for certain this is what you want  I will continue singing GA s praises throughout my career  Without my GA family  I would not have been

course worthwhile was the instruction and peer support The lead instructor I had then is no longer teaching there full time  nor on the same curriculum  His onboarding processes and methods of instruction were efficient and effective  Our   cohort was given a breadth first overview of web development with enough depth to provide us enough of a base for further personal investigation  Make no mistake  What you get out of this program has everything to do with what you put in In terms of outcomes  almost all of us found jobs in the profession within a year  but not painlessly or without heartache  My own job search took almost half a year  A few of my classmates got hired right out the door  but most of us were not  Part of that had to do with their prior tech experience  while for my part  I lack polish in certain areas of my dress and demeanor  a constant work in progress  Overall  General Assembly lacked any sort of direct pipeline or apprenticeship mechanism to get students real experience  One or two people pinging you every week about whether you ve been keeping up with the resume numbers game isn t efficient One of the biggest benefits to choosing GA was keeping in

s difficult to combat market forces as an individual  you just have to roll with it  Gain the necessary skills popular in the tech market in your area  eg  Rails is popular in Chicago  but not as much

tech hub  MOVE  ABC  Always Be Coding  Learning never stops  the greater variety of problems and experiences you expose yourself to  the more you ll learn  You ll always be picking up new techniques to solve problems you encounter  Side gigs can be valuable experience  in terms of listing them on your resume and or portfolio  You re really being taught how to learn new technical concepts and skills on your own  No program can provide you motivation  that comes from within  Meet people in your profession  when it comes to getting jobs  it s not always about being able to power through

Seattle and finally settled on General Assembly There were a couple factors that led me to choose GA For one  I needed a shorter program  although if you can   swing doing a longer one  by all means do it  More time to program can only help make you a stronger candidate afterwards Another factor was my experience with the staff at a preview event  You could definitely see the polish in regards to how they market their program and everything was highly organized with staff and teachers present for you to meet and ask any questions you had  Honestly I could tell that people really liked working there and it showed  Previous students talked highly of their experience and this was a major factor for me The biggest X Factor for me was making sure my teachers were solid  Our cohort originally had one of the longest tenured instructors scheduled to teach our course  and I had the opportunity to meet him at a preview event  Sadly  he ended up leaving for another job right before our bootcamp started which meant we were stuck with 2 first time teachers  Even though this was not GA s fault  it still negatively impacted our cohort  One student left during the program because of this  However  GA did offer supplemental classes for us at the end and did their best to support us  So make sure you interview the teachers beforehand to see who you re getting  it makes a huge difference Otherwise  the community is great  GA has the advantage of having a huge network of staff  students  and connections all over the world  They also teach multiple classes on different aspects related to the tech world including UX Design  Data Science  and Project Management which offers more opportunities to cross mingle and network with others in different disciplines  This is a big plus  especially if you re new to tech The new Seattle facility is in a great location and offers generous spaces to work and mingle and have the occasional networking event to share a few beers with others The one thing I d say that might need improvement is the pre work segment  Numerous boot camps tackle this issue differently so I m sure they are all still working it out  GA s was about 20 40 hrs of pre work  depending on how quickly or familiar you already are with coding  I d seen some boot camps have 100 hrs minimum  While it was nice to know that I didn t have to do as much work  I also found out that I needed probably a little more help in prepping for Javascript prior to the course since when you get started  it s hard to catch up if you fall behind  But each person s experience will vary I m sure  Also  just to re emphasize  make sure your teachers are good  Ask other students who have been taught by them  Do your homework  It s a lot of money you re investing Also be aware that after the program  you will need to do most of the work to find a job on your own  It doesn t mean they won t provide resources and some prep training  but in no way does this guarantee a job  While they might say expect 3 months for the job search  think more like 6 months at least'),(2391,7,92,'Anonymous','True',2017,'True','2018-02-22','2018-02-22','4.0','5.0','4.0','3.0','Pros 1  Instructors

enough to land a full time developer job  It helped me understand coding itself isn t hard ot learn and builds confidence in people to be able to understand the different   coding languages to begin building basic apps  It helped create a portfolio to show to prospective employers and to find ways to constantly improve  I learned a lot more about the tech industry while going through the course as well since we were able to meet multiple people who worked at various tech companies and they explained to us what helped them land the jobs  GA made sure to incorporate the most up to date frameworks that were tailored to the city I lived in as this would help us with landing a job locally  They also made sure to give classes on other languages and frameworks to have basic understandings of them and to know how to attack a new language if requested by a company  Some cons would be they re obviously a private company so they re looking for the money in the long run and we saw this when they were pumping out courses every 6 weeks  This lead to a some what saturation of junior devs in a market that was still transitioning to the dev bootcamp hiring process and some employers weren t too keen on hiring these types of people yet  So a lot of the graduates sat around hunting jobs longer than was stated  Another major con to me was the fact they were teaching the most recent frameworks to essentially just land jobs when say learning more vanilla javascript may be better suited in the long term  However I understand they do want to get their graduates hired so having the newest skillset is what sells  Having a strong background in just vanilla javascript or really whichever primary language is being taught would go a lot further than all the frameworks

throughout the course with the homework  we received little to no feedback  I have friends who graduated from all the other bootcamps  their school gave them a ton of feedback and extra help if necessary  They had a much better ratio of students to instructor ratio  less than 10  Did I mention there were 55 students in my class  We separated into 2 classes  3 main instructors  2 instructor associates  and 1 teaching assistant  We had one teaching assistant after 5pm for 55 students  All the other instructors usually leave at 5  Fortunately  my classmates helped each other which got me through the class  General Assembly gave  750 credit to each student because they felt bad about us not giving us enough help after 5pm  Lets do the math here  each student paid  13 500  and there were 55 of us  over  740 000 and they couldn t hire another teaching assistant  We found out that upper management heard our complaints  but just ignored us  A few of the students who actually

certifications  and I did a lot of research before choosing this course  I thought about how I could try to most closely replicate the experience of being a web developer  and a three and a half month course seemed like the clear   answer Maybe it is the answer  but doing it with GA is not  My class was a complete mess  There were a ton of what I would simply call  configuration errors    a mistake in the lesson plan that would mess up half the class  instructors not knowing how to explain something well because they are only 24 or 25  and confusing instructions that sent half the class on a total wild goose chase  Our class size was proportionally pretty small  it was like 1 teacher for every three students  in theory  But in effect only really one teacher is on the clock at any given time  and because the lesson plans are so bad that one person can rarely get the entire class through a lesson in a way that gets the content actually understood I don t think it is a coincidence that the four or so people who are going through with flying colors have either a computer science degree  or  I mean this literally  a spouse that is currently a web developer  Hey  I don t begrudge those people at all   If I shared a roof with someone who was a web dev I would absolutely be bouncing ideas off them  But what is more telling is the fact that the portion of the students without a cs degree or resource at home to help us  we re just failing  Our projects  which are supposed to be making our  portfolio  are a total mess  Not anything that would be presentable to another human being  And already a third of the class has failed out  Some of us were raising the alarm the 6th day of this course   the first day of week 2   and basically got ignored  I know I specifically asked if I could withdraw and move to the next class  to do more research  amp  practice  since it was obvious to me I could use more prep  I was told they  don t do that  and now nine weeks and 13 500 dollars into this I am still struggling  and the instructors are indifferent  We who don t get the material have been raising the alarm every chance we get  and are treated like we are overreacting or being silly  Well  that starts to feel sort of personal when thirteen hundred dollars poorer you don t feel like you are getting a quality understanding of web development  which is what we paid for  In my case  what I left my very solid and wonderful job for  It was a big risk  and i thought if I tried hard enough and put in the right amount of work this course would at least meet me halfway and give me an understanding of web development  In reality  it has just been three months of stress with no tangible outcome I try to be pretty positive  and I still hope I can make something productive out of this experience  But I m really righting this to warn anyone else to look at a different program and company than GA  I just can t imagine that similar programs everywhere could possibly be this flawed  It is really an embarrassment  or would be  but GA is a for profit institution so who knows whether they are just laughing their way to the bank  I also really  really fault this program for marketing itself as something suitable for 100  career changers  Myself and at least one other classmate are actually in hi tech jobs   or were up until this course  and are still having a really hard time  So when they say this is suitable for  anyone  that is definitely just a move to get your money  and wager on the fact that some people will fade out quietly Which has happened to some of my classmates  so I guess they are right on that count  Please consider any other program  Please ask about the statistics for people finishing the course vs  auditing  it  and don t get distracted by

question who makes that choice unless you aren t necessarily the sharpest tool in the shed as it pertains to web dev  which would also explain a whole helluva lot about the poor quality of the education I ve seemed to get from some of them I think this can be done  and I think this type of program should probably be the answer for people trying to change their career  But I think GA is a

before you start the course and not focus on things you d been sold on learning    Varying Staff Skill  We had one instructor that was an absolute flop  and many of the instructors seem to have no

feel like reading this epistle  skip to the bottom and read the section on  What to expect if you are thinking I ve been learning HTML and CSS off and on over the past six years  I bought books and read them  Did online tutorials  Had friends and co workers walk me through the basics of HTML and CSS  I cannot tell you how many times I have created the  Hello World  page  I have learned a bit over the years  but not enough to be considered dangerous by any stretch of the imagination I m currently working at FamilySearch as a UX UI designer  Been there for a little over two and a half years  and during that time our webDev team put together a skills building program  A set of requirements that demonstrates understanding  application  and proficiency of core HTML  CSS and JS principles  Developed for our webDevs  our UX El Jefe challenged the designers to get certified in a different discipline in order to have a more well rounded understanding of how our designs are implemented in the code I cannot emphasize this enough  to learn how to code has been one of the best career decisions I have ever made The more we know how the web works  the better we can design for it  A painter knows paint  A sculptor knows clay or marble  Musicians understand acoustics  feedback  mics  guitars  pianos  etc  There s a technical aspect to every medium  The better a designer understands the technical aspects of their craft  the better their designs Tom DeForest  UX Heros  John DilworthEnter General AssemblyI did my homework and developed my own objectives as aligned with FamilySearch s goals towards certification  Then I contacted General Assembly  GA  and told them I was interested in their program  Based on my prior learnings if you could even call them that  I felt like I had enough background in HTML CSS to make the course do able and help me get certified  I received the course outline for GA s FEWD program and ran it past my webDev managers  They thought it was a solid curriculum and gave it their blessing My FEWD class was taught by two developers  the course instructor is a professional in the web development community  and the TA is a recent graduate from the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program  My class was 10 weeks long and held on Saturdays from 10 5 at their Santa Monica LA campus  Class size was about 30 35 students I was really happy with the course  The highlights for me were  learning and understanding the HTML CSS JS syntax and document structure  responsive design and utilizing media queries  some Bootstrap and how to use the responsive framework  how to talk to my devs and use their terminology when communicating my designs  This one sounds a little funny  but it s true  learning how to ask Google  Google will tell you anything you want it to  as long as you know how to ask correctly  If I have questions about code  syntax  structure  etc  I now know how to ask  Creating WordPress themes  This was a bonus  We built a custom theme in class based on a previous homework assignment  I was even able to turn my final project into a WordPress theme based on that class To graduate from the FEWD program there were essentially two requirements  attend 80  of the classes  and build a site that demonstrated what we learned  GA wanted us to build a multiple page site with linking pages  and use of HTML CSS JS Coding is a language  If you re not going to use it  you re going to lose it  Stay on top of it  Also  learn to jump in and figure it out What to expect if you are thinking about taking this class If you want to get the most out of this course  code  Then code some more  The best way to learn is repetition  I probably spent an additional 10 15 hours per week outside of class time coding  I did my homework  Deleted it  And did it again  The course is expensive  Get everything you can out of it The course is designed to increase your skill set  not to get you a job as a developer  If you are looking to change careers  this is not that kind of course  You will want the Web Development Immersive course or something similar You are not going to learn how to design for the web  You are going to learn how to code The lessons are structured as high level primers with code a longs  The instructors expect you to take the initiative and learn to delve deeper on your own  Instructors are always available for questions and help I wish the instructors talked more about best practices and correct principles and guidelines The course seemed to cater to the people who were struggling with coding concepts  It slowed the overall pace of the class Make use of lab time and the instructors  office hours  Their time is invaluable  Use it There are always events going on at the Santa Monica campus

over the course of the class  My site looked bland to me and not how I envisioned it in my mind or in the wireframe I created  My mentor told me I would have to take additional classes to learn the tools I needed to make my website look like I wanted The curriculum was dated 2014 in several places and a handful of the resource links no longer went to valid pages  The handout they gave us on specs for mobile designs stopped at an iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 S5  It looked to me like the curriculum hasn t been updated in three years and we all know tech moves quickly as far as new innovations go  I learn by doing and there wasn t enough hands on for me  Lots of video lectures  links to resources  small coding challenges and one weekly project consisting of work on the one website you are creating  The best part was the weekly lectures where an instructor walked through the coding steps of what you just learned  Unfortunately  these lectures are not offered live so you don t have the opportunity to ask a question After the course  I had a one month access to the coursework  Most online schools now give you lifetime access I did learn HTML and CSS  but this course

the curricula for part time courses are incredibly solid  The instructors were very good at the subject as well as teaching  If you take initiative to schedule   time with them to go over your portfolio  they go out of their way to help you or suggest next steps  In Front End  there were probably 9 people out of the 15 classmates who ended up directly using what they learned in class to leverage new jobs or promotions in their roles  For both these courses  I will say that you have to work really hard  but if you do  you get results  These courses are only 40 60 hours of in class time  plus homework  lots of it  if you are passionate about getting good  I would assume if you didn t put a lot of work in it wouldn t be reasonable to expect a job out of it at the end  So basically my advice is Nobody at GA is going to force you to do the most  They have designed a quality course that gives you the skill set  if you work at it If you want a job change or promotion out of this and are just doing the bare minimum  you have to consider explaining to an interviewer how doing 40 60 hours of work  a basic work week  is going to justify you being the right one for the job

resources with them  and connect with people who will help you and hold you accountable  While I sometimes found the lectures and instruction only scratched the surface of certain topics  and was disappointed that others weren t covered at all  the foundational material and group projects were enough to help me build a portfolio  land interviews  and secure a position shortly after completing

instructors and teaching assistants from a broad and diverse background  Students grow as strategic design thinkers and this is tied directly to success and impact in the immersive  There is a good balance between personal growth and team collaborative work  One of the cons that I and others in my cohort noticed from this 10 week immersive  is that the time tends to wind down pretty quickly and the career placement and outcomes portion of the immersive tends to feel somewhat rushed and slapped on at the ending weeks  This leaves little time to prepare polished case studies and portfolio

coffee perks  And this is about it  I would love to say I liked my fellow students  but because we were competition most of them were cold  selfish  and aggressive While I m grateful to my teachers for what they were able to expose me to  I have to be honest by leaving this review  If I had read an honest review I would have never taken the boot camp The structure of the learning material is horrible  It is mostly presented in small slides with jokes that are articles you can find yourself online and lots of games   exercises  Please spare yourself money and time and play with people by attending meetups  They barely teach you any tools you will need to become a UX designer but throw it on you and you have to  figure it out yourself  Practically no help Too many students  I complained about it from the start when I was promised 15 18 people at max and ended up with 25  Imagine how impersonal it was  And while I appreciate the teaching strategy to listen to everyone who has questions  25 students asking questions  and some of them are  that personality  of asking every dumb question they can think of  took most of the time out of the day  Coffee breaks every 1 2 hours that will take sometimes up to 30 mins means your day is basically a 4 5 hour day  Let me say it this way  I spent money and quit my job to learn  not to enjoy coffee breaks  While I would love it as a kid at elementary school  as an adult that was unacceptable on how much  free time  we were given Out of a 10 week course  the last 3 weeks are team projects  that I consider unfair  again  to pay money so I can have zero teachings but work on my own  That could have been after boot camp is over  Not enough knowledge to swim by only having 7 weeks to learn the profession Career coach  While I enjoyed the personality of my career coach and think she is great  15 mins each time just wasn t enough  Yes  15 mins are all you get  The first 5 mins remind her about who you are and what you are trying to achieve and the 10 mins left are just a joke  We only had 2 coaches  not enough No opportunities or assistance provided  Took me 7 months to get my job  and I never had even 1 interview opportunity from GA  All the mixers  career fairs  etc  have barely any employers that are hiring  It s a joke really  so many alumni and no job opportunities whatsoever  Same as their online job

tutor that will give you much more knowledge  Think about it  They don t teach you anything about the latest technologies that you can t find online  When I graduated and I continued learning on my own for 7 months and I finally got my first paid project  I realized that I was not taught anything that is very important nowadays like responsive design  ADA compliance  how to work with developers  and technical tools that are vital to successfully performing a job Portfolio  Yes  they promise you will have 3 projects in your portfolio that will help you to find a job  Guess what   25 students will have almost the same portfolio and will be at the same time on the market along with at least half the students from the previous class hunting with the same techniques  You will look like

of these courses will have pros and cons  which you have to weigh before you choose one  But you absolutely have to put in the work or you won t get as much out   of it  Also   prepare yourself for what you re getting into  read this General Assembly s full time UX course is the only full time in person course that I know of in the L A  area  It is also the most expensive option that I am aware of But  since I could live with my parents if I stayed in Los Angeles  and wanted to do in person because online learning isn t a great option for me  and didn t want a course that would take 6  months to complete  and taking into consideration that I would likely end up working in Los Angeles  I went with GA PROS Professor  My professor  Gerrit  was awesome  He explained complex issues really well  was relaxed and calm in his demeanor  provided helpful feedback  and was always honest and transparent  He brought in explanations and rationales based on personal experience and was originally a graphic designer  which was nice since that is part of my background Classmates  I loved that I was in an in person program  My class was about 17 students  which at times felt like a lot  but I am ultimately grateful because I enjoyed the groups I was in  loved meeting and learning with new people  and overall was honored to be surrounded by people from such a wide variety of backgrounds  experiences  and ages  I enjoy surrounding myself with those who are different than me so I am continuously challenged Job Support  While I just finished the program last week  I ve enjoyed the openness and support from our Career Coach  He s easy going  readily available  easily reachable  and pushes you to utilize him for help  He helps with interview prep  portfolio  and cover letter review  and you can go to him for pretty much anything and if he can t specifically help  he ll go out of his way to find someone who can  which is amazing Group projects and portfolio pieces  I also chose an in person course so I could work on projects with a team since that is how it likely is in a job  I enjoyed my teammates and I gained valuable experience in learning how to balance personalities and differences of opinion  We got to work with a real client as our last project which is great as well since the other two are spec projects  One project is also solely focused on your portfolio  and GA puts a lot of emphasis on trying to make you as career ready as possible CONS Coding Development  The primary gripe I have but didn t negatively impact my experience  is that we don t work on projects with developers  I don t know if that is something other schools do  but it would be smart to pair up UX students with someone from the web development classes to work on a project together  Designers have to work with developers in a professional setting  so it s great practice to do that in a school setting The course also didn t cover any coding basics  but they give you  500 towards their courses  and you can take night classes and all day weekend classes to learn some basics  which is what I did  You can also do that for visual design  job prep and more  So I don t see that as much of a negative  but some might Price  GA is definitely the most expensive school I looked into  which means my loan is bigger  but the school could use to be a few grand cheaper  Here s to hoping I just get high paying job Admissions variations  While I naturally get neurotic when making major decisions so I spent weeks  sometimes even months  doing research on programs and UX in general before I chose this program  But many students don t necessarily do that  Some students in my class were told different things by different admissions people  and there really needs to be consistency so all students are coming in equally prepared  For example  if students don t have any visual design experience  they should be prepared for what they will need and spend time learning  Or if students want to work while doing a full time program  they should be heavily warned against it   not casually warned against it Interaction design  We didn t spend too much time on learning the nitty gritty of this  which  in a sense  makes sense since it s only an 11 week course and UX is a massive discipline with many verticals  But a quick project on it would have been nice LAST THOUGHTSAgain   I spent a lot of time preparing myself for this course mentally and financially  I watched YouTube videos  read Medium articles  talked to folks who took the course before  and really made sure its was the right fit and the right decision  I come from a graphic design and marketing background  which was incredibly useful  So take what I am saying with a grain of salt  Some students in my class came from wildly different backgrounds  like acting  music and finance  If you feel like you need to take a few brief courses in things like visual design or the like to prep  it s incredibly useful and just makes it so you won t fall behind'),(2584,7,93,'Anonymous','True',2018,'True','2019-01-24','2019-01-24','2.0','3.0','2.0','1.0','I attended this program in Austin  TX  I

have an onsite interview with Amazon on 10 days after I graduated for a Designer Role  I am going through a recruiting agency but it was the resume rebuild that the outcomes program helped me with and   my portfolio that was also designed in class that helped set me up  I received some prep info from the recruiting agency  after hearing what the company is looking for  I am confident that I have learned the skills needed from taking UXDI course  The next step is the interview process and making sure that I articulate my process clearly  something that is also taught as part of the immersive course  GA stresses so much how important networking is  and through networking is how I was able to get this onsite interview  I didn t wait till after I was done with the course before networking  I started early and told friends  family and anyone else who asked  what are you up to these days  about how I was going to a design school and where I wanted to be after  So when this role became available  a friend of mine contacted me and told me they have a opening for the role  Granted I didn t get hired or had the onsite yet  what happened here alone is a testament to how important networking is and that is why GA stresses it so much   Disclosure  I m a very optimistic person  trying to find the lessons in every thing negative that happens so take that into consideration when reading my reviews  About the school itself  I had a great experience attending the course  I made new friends with talented people that I still keep in contact with  I was fortunate enough to be able to take time away from working so I can fully immerse myself into the course  I understand that there are bills that need to be paid but it is also a huge load of stress of your shoulders if you don t have to worry about working at the same time since the immersive course is a 9 5 kind of thing  I usually stayed a bit later and some days till 8pm when they kick me out working on projects and other things  The instructor we had was very knowledgable and experienced  he was able to answer every question we had in a manner that he didn t just hand us the answer  but asked thought provoking questions that would lead us to the answer  Theres an instructor assistant who was also very knowledgeable and welcome as well that we were able to bounce ideas off of  Their feedback was also constructive and provided valuable insight  They re not here to hold your hand but they will support you when and where they can  Some other benefits is that you could attend any workshop that was hosted at GA for free  and there was also a hackathon at the end of the program  It was a great experience working under pressure with people you ve never met before  I feel like I benefitted from this course a lot and that it set me up to make the transition into the design field  The amount of work you put is what you ll get out of it to be honest  if you decide to put in as little as possible then of course you re going to benefit as little as possible  As RW3 would say   the separation is in the preparation  If you plan on taking this course  my advice is do everything as early as possible  If my resume wasn t ready to go right after I graduated then I wouldn t have been able to send it to the recruiter for my interview thats coming up  I also decided to code my own website using boot strap so that was a learning curve and took some time to polish as well  I m still not done polishing it  but I started 2 weeks before class ended  The only con I have is that its tough to schedule a time with the Outcomes Person  Theres only 1 person for Seattle and she s awesome but getting that individual help takes some time  When I realized that this was going to become an issue  I

would have with the cohort  I was totally satisfied in regards to those thigs  I know there are cheaper ways to go about a pivot such as this  but the immersive experience and the connection with

background has been in the restaurant industry  where I spent 19years in all positions FOH and some BOH  A couple of years ago  I was faced with a very scary decision  I had to decide how to get out of the restaurant industry and make a name for myself   I took the Mobile Development program at TIY  another bootcamp school  which has subsequently closed down  I was hired on as a junior developer for a local agency for about 8 months  In that time  I learned development did not have my heart  I was spending more time worried about colors and the look of each view controller  Then  when they merged with another large agency  I was laid off Time to re group  I decided to attend one of GA s night 101 classes for Visual Design  they offer these short hour long classes to go over the syllabus for all immersive programs at night    just to see what it was about   and  I left with a HUGE smile on my face  This spoke to my soul  I took the part time Visual Design class  never had I been pushed so hard in the field of computer design   and  never had I felt SOOOO rewarded in the end  I was addicted  I asked my instructor how to make this my career  He was kind enough to go through both main avenues  one would be to do it on my own and he went through how I would do it  Then  he went through the other route  attend the immersive program for UXDI  After weighing my options  I chose to take the immersive program  and I am SOOOO glad I did  I got more foundational education on ALL aspects of User Experience Design than I would have gotten on my own  The instructor  like my former Visual Design teacher  was HUGELY supportive and took time to make sure everyone felt comfortable with the fast pace and curriculum intense daily learning  We took breaks often and was mostly at suggestion for the class  they wanted to offer breaks as we needed them  The other thing I learned that was rather a surprise to me  was how to choose my desired role in User Experience Design  there are four MAIN quadrants and subsequent sub roles  and how to live in that role  Real world experience was well integrated in the curriculum  almost as seamless as the curriculum itself  We had the opportunity to dream about our own personal project  which I am still working on because it speaks to my heart  and we were able to work with real clients on our last project  My client continued working with me after the course was done and I was hired on for his personal project for the first part of my new career  Towards the end of the course  we had multiple speakers who work as seniors in their field and they shared a short lecture on their day to day  staying afterwards to satisfy all questions  We heard from those in User experience as well as the instructor for the Developer class to better prepare how interactions in the real world occur between designers and developers  Even though I have dabbled in the developer field  I worked in such a large agency  I did not communicate with designers  so I found this very helpful  I would be happy to answer any questions for anyone looking to take this course  but if you are interested in building making designing

with what I wanted to do  After continual   research and soul searching  I found out about UX Design and thought it would be the perfect extension of my degree in Psychology with the added creativity that was missing in my career  Also through that research  I stumbled upon General Assembly and was considering their part time and full time UX Design programs  After lots of planning  I decided to quit my full time job to complete the 10 week  full time UX Design Immersive program at General Assembly  It was the scariest decision I ve ever made  But it also was the best thing I ve ever done The program itself was very eye opening for me  I had an idea of what UX Design was as a whole  but I did not know what the day to day work would be like  I don t think I could have put together a cohesive portfolio without this program  It gave me my foundation of design thinking  which I still use today  but design is a continually evolving field that requires constant learning and building

experience that you want to supplement  This is not a 10 week program that will magically turn you into a designer  It is a great starting point  but an expensive one if you are nervous or hesitant about what you will do with it afterward  As long as you go into it knowing that a lot of work is required after you finish the program  then it is one of the greatest things you can do to get one

classes nearly tripled in size and the quality plummeted  I can say that my time in the UX Immersive class was well worth the time and money  I initially took the class mainly for the job support  which was very underwhelming  The career coaches were knowledgeable but not very helpful  they would basically just push us to keep applying to jobs and if we didn t apply to 10x week  then we would lose career coaching  which was pretty ridiculous  I got a freelance job right out of the class by luck and that lasted 3 months  I reached out to my career coach once the job ended and they told me that I had already received the support because I landed a job  which is funny  considering they didn t even help me find that job  The career coach that worked with us over the course of the 10 weeks

 web design  and marketing  I wanted to move into UX Design but felt like I needed something more formal to help me feel comfortable making the transition PROSOverall  I had a very positive experience with GA  The curriculum and projects were the right amount of challenging  and I felt like I was able to really get a lot out of the coursework  I like the combination of lecture and project work

people who had both good and bad experiences with their instructors  Students without a design background will likely struggle with feeling prepared after this course  In my opinion  there should be stricter requirements for prior experience before taking this course  If you don t have any background in design or web development  it s less likely you will have a successful job search  The reality is that companies  at least in Seattle  want you to have a certain amount of relevant experience even for entry level positions  This is just my opinion  but it s based on what I saw during my experience and the job search of those in my cohort To sum up  if you have a background in design or a relevant field and are considering the UXDI program at GA to help with transitioning to a UX Design position  talk to others who have taken the program from that specific location  learn more about the instructors  and attend info sessions  You can also look at the profiles of previous

Master s Degree at an University  Here are my thoughts on each of them and why I settled on a 5th option  guided live non degree instruction at General Assembly  The MOOCs were designed for students to dip their toes in to understand fit   interest and are mostly theory based  YouTube had a layer of drama and video graphics into it and wasn t as intuitive to follow or helpful to put into practice since it s hard to learn without live exercises or problems to test your understanding  Multiple Choice certainly doesn t help  MIT Open CourseWare was fantastic but you needed many pre requisites and made it hard to pickup and a Master s Degree was extremely lethargic and too price and time expensive  2 3 years  requires an application process  there goes another 6 9 months  and  80 100k USD

professionals who are part time instructors  rather than a Professor who hasn t stepped out of the classroom for a decade  I stumbled across General Assembly as I was tiring in my search for material   having racked up multiple edX org and Coursera certifications but without any real understanding to put these learnings into practice  Within 2 3 hours of review research and a phone call with the GA support team to understand fit  FYI very honest at if this is the right fit or not and who would be taking it with you  I signed up for a Data Analytics remote GA class  The instructor worked in the technology   data management arm within California s state government and was very transparent at what is and is not used in his daily work  He had come up through the course as well and so knew what were the painpoints that we would experience  picking up SQL or Tableau for the first time  The class curriculum was fresh  easy to follow  and most importantly it was 5 6 weeks at a fraction of the cost and gave me a good enough understanding to hold my own confidently in an interview  All expectations are checked every week and the classmates  from all over the country  work in rotating pairs

obviously not updated or had typos   not great when you re paying  15K  Also  sometimes it seems like the instructors do not review lessons beforehand and that they are simply filling in the code based on solutions they have on the side  For the most part it didn t bother me too much since I don t expect them to know everything but just be prepared to ask questions and self study when things don t make sense  GA s Outcomes team is great and full of resources to help you in the job search process including resume and portfolio reviews  interview prep  etc  The only potential issue I can

areas of data mining  data analytics and databases  I found the course to be offering more than I expected  This is a very intense course and requires a lot   of dedication during the entire 12 weeks  I learnt around 60 different Data Science models apart from skills like Python  basics of Big data  Spark  Hadoop  Web scraping etc  I hear a lot about the outcome program being not so good  My personal experience is that the expectation around outcome  job assistance  program from students is not realistic  Which I believe is the main cause for few students to complain about the outcome part of the course  Practically  any job seeker has to make himself herself presentable to the market and make himself herself eligible to be able to deliver value in a Data Science role in the industry  Is the Data Science Immersive course capable of making you industry ready  Of course it is  But  under one condition  which is applicable to any form of learning  Learning is a two way process  If you are willing to understand what the industry requires and how you can leverage and benefit from the course  I do not see a better course than the one offered by General Assembly  But  if you do not have the right mindset and willingness to put in hard work  no course can make you employable  If you truly love working with data  if you truly love solving problems  and if you truly love programming then this course will certainly add a lot of value in your career in a very short time  On the contrary  students who blindly jump into this program expecting that the outcome program can fetch them the  Sexiest job of 21st Century  just because they have paid a huge course fee  then that is unrealistic  Keep in mind that you can t buy a job or knowledge by paying any amount of money  you have to earn it yourself Oh yeah  I forgot to mention about the dynamic  modest  experienced and student friendly staff at General Assembly  And the kind of network you will get both from

instruction is the way to go  2  I also like that they offer a wide variety of topics from web development and digital marketing to project management  sales pitching  and communication skills  3  The instructors I ve had so far have been knowledgeable and nice  4  They have many free talks in the evenings  sometimes even with free nibbles  I attended one on the art of sales pitching  I think it was called something like  How to Sell Anything to Anyone  The speaker was excellent  and he gave really good tips  Cons  1  Cost  If you want to take their multi day courses  expect to pay   That s what you gotta expect for in person classes from a private school  I d love to take more classes  but I can t be spending thousands and thousands of dollars  Yes  they have a payment plan  but you still gotta pay them back  2  If you re looking to start a new career  don t expect to be  career ready  after you ve spent all that money  The classes don t go into much depth  They re more of an overview  just enough to get you started  3  They never answer the phone  The only way to get a response is via email  If you re on your way to an evening or weekend class and need to reach someone  you won t get a response if it s outside normal business hours  I once signed up for a Saturday class and was about to head out the door  when I just happened to notice an email on my phone  It was from GA  saying the class had been canceled  Uh  they should have TEXTED instead  I normally don t open my email if I m headed out the door  but just by pure luck  I did this time  I would have been annoyed if I had to battle traffic and pay for parking  only to learn the class was canceled  To top it off  the email didn t even say  sorry    just something euphemistically annoying like  thanks

was a 10 week digital marketing course which I believe is one of the most intensive among other courses you can take in GA  I had been working in an overseas owned e commerce company as a purchasing staff for over 5 years and   I witnessed how online shopping became more accepted and trusted among Hong Kong consumers during my tenure  However  I just didn t have the knowledge about how this works  At the same time I also felt that I have reached a career plateau in which I was doing the same and repetitive tasks at work  So I went on Googling different short courses of digital marketing  hoping to familiarize myself with this area before I decide to switch career field  then of course I stumbled on GA  I didn t swipe my credit card immediately for a course  it was a rather and quite informed decision  and turns out to be one that I didn t regret  I first attended a free event hosted by GA in which a few speakers share their insight of digital marketing trend in Hong Kong  One of the speakers later became my course instructor  her name is Tina  Among the professional speakers there was someone from HSBC Hong Kong headquarter too  to show how GA is well trusted enough to have these people as guest speakers for them  After the event I actually talked to Tina and I personally felt that she is a genuine person and is also well experienced in this field   I have to say first impression is important and when you can meet your instructor even before the course starts  it makes a difference  After that event I decided to give GA a chance  GA s course is not cheap but well worth it  In the first class they set you up with GA intranet login from which you can download or preview the course slides  do pre class homework online and upload your answers  You can basically do these paperlessly or even when you are on your way to work in the morning  There is also a chat app for students to raise questions outside of the class hours  making it a wall less classroom  The learning material that my instructor  Tina had prepared include class slides of descriptive content  graphs illustration  and some extra reading sources  there is also mini homework such as reading assignment and a few questions in each  In each class there are lots of technical demonstration and hands on guidance  with the chance to ask questions and help  Lastly there is a final presentation project as a chance to demonstrate how much you have learned  and you can base the project on your real job assignment too  Taking this course with GA you won t have to worry about whether the course content is rich enough to weigh the worth of the course fee  you rather have to worry about not having enough time to digest the intensive yet practical teaching you receive in each class  So actually halfway through the course I was hired by a trading company of which the boss was eager to expand his business on an e commerce shopping website  From every assignment to the final project of this course  everything in it prepared me to know how to fulfill my boss s business plan  I could even make suggestions to him when he was unsure how to approach  If anyone is looking for digital marketing

if you re a digital   marketing ninja  there is a significant amount of ground to cover  in a very short space of time  As I mentioned there is a practical component  you ll fail if you do not use the recommended tools to achieve whatever objective is set with your client  To maximise the value that you ll gain from participating in this course   	I would suggest that you try to familiarise yourself with a couple of the online tools that digital marketers deploy in their roles   	Although some of the tools that you ll use are free  To gain access to the full functionality of the tools you may need to pay for a month s access  So  factor this in 	Do not just focus on the tactical aspects of digital marketing  You may need to consider deploying a digital marketing strategy on an international basis  How would you develop an international digital marketing strategy  from a technical  and organisational  internal and external teams  perspective   	If you have access to a digital marketing community  ask experts who are in a role that you re planning to aim for in the future  for advice on what they would try to gain from a similar course  On completion of the course  I  d recommend that you continue to develop your skills  Technology never stands  still  so neither can you  The quality of the course content is on par with that of a master s degree course  The lectures were exceptional  the environment was intense but friendly  An added bonus is that there are events  with speakers from well known tech brands  In terms of securing new roles  I do believe

not learn anything from the course  I feel that the quality of instruction could have been better   While the instructor for this accelerated digital marketing   course is knowledgeable and provided a good overview of digital marketing  he is not an expert in all areas of digital marketing  I feel that the course could have benefitted from having additional guest lecturers who are industry experts who can share specific best practices   For example  for a topic like social media influencer marketing  GA could have asked the Creative Director of an ad agency to come in for 2 hours to explain best practices and share recent case studies on successful influencer marketing campaigns  Our instructor only touched on this area very briefly and most of the time  it was just his opinion on how such influencer marketing campaigns are not effective  I disagree because influencer marketing is still widely used in the industry today and job seekers applying for marketing jobs are still expected to know how to execute such campaigns   During the presentation  the instructor emphasized a lot on presentation skills but none of this was touched on during the week  Perhaps we need to dedicate an hour or two to this during the week  especially since doing presentations and pitches are an important part of digital marketing  In addition  a short 1 1 time of 15 minutes during the week might have been helpful for fine tuning our presentations   With a culmination of all these factors  I feel that I have gained some additional knowledge but my understanding of seeing everything come together in building a marketing campaign still remains rudimentary   I was  upsold  this course by the Senior Admissions Producer even though I wanted to do the 5 week Digital Marketing Circuit   The communication before the course began was quite lacking  It was not clear how to access the onboarding pre reading for the course on Schoology  The links and readings were not placed on Schoology in a way that was easy to click on and the site navigation was not intuitive    I spent a weekend rushing through the onboarding readings after I found them on the site   As part of the course requirements  we were instructed to find a real world company for our actual project case study  Again  these instructions were buried on the Schoology site  It was a mad rush that weekend trying to find a suitable company for my case study   Instructions on Schoology also required students to get access to various platforms  eg Google Analytics for your case study company  Screaming Frog  Optimizely  Neither Optimizely nor Screaming Frog was used during the course  The requirements during onboarding and the actual requirements during the course are not in sync   The email communication from the Education Programs Producer did not make clear the urgency of getting these requirements before the course began   During the course itself  the instructor said getting the company for the case study wasn t mandatory  This was frustrating to hear  As someone who self funded this course in order to make a career switch  I wanted to get the most value out of the course  and not having an actual case study to work on was detrimental to my learning and the value I got out of the course   I feel that the course was not a value for money experience due to the tardy communication and the gaps in the knowledge of the instructor  It is not a course I would recommend to friends looking to learn more about digital marketing'),(2724,7,87,'Jenny','False',2018,'True','2018-05-03','2018-05-03','4.5','5.0','4.0','nan','I recently completed a 5 week digital marketing course with GA circuit   it was definitely a great

standpoint  the depth of my experience in   execution of a digital strategy  I felt  had a few gaps  I walked in to General Assembly to find out more about the courses on offer  The admissions point of contact was a young gentleman and was surely friendly  but lacked the depth in industry experience and could not answer my specific questions  I was oscillating between GA in Melbourne and short course with Harvard Uni and the cost of the courses were about 2k to 3 k more at Harvard of course  However  I upon much consideration I went with GA  because the faculty profile seemed more suitable for what I was looking for   to be able to deep into the execution only to know the nuances of it and not really or necessarily work on it hands on  The 10 week program was a great deep dive into the mechanics of a campaign and channels and strengthened the strategic thinking that backs the campaigns  The faculty Steve Toms is particular was absolutely fabulous from day 1  His focus to make sure that the entire class got a grip of digital marketing was simply stupendous  Maria the supporting faculty was great too  I would highly recommend any marketing course taught by Steve at GA  A particular mention to the flexibility of the curriculum  Steve actually included a component that was not initially part of the course  simply bcos of the market demands from when we had started the course  So GA yes  The only little side note would be the pace of the course  which was a bit accelerated and that means it could get pretty hectic to do justice to the course

since been raised to  3950  as a professional who already has abundance of experience in the research and data analysis domain  The biggest sell for me at the time of orientation   was GA s highly advertised Google Analytics usage part of the course  since GA is a purported  partner  The level of exposure and hands on experience through the curriculum was supposed to be enough to lead to Google Analytics certification  In reality  this class mainly turned out to be a marketing class  with the digital aspect  i e  Google Analytics  relegated to the final 3 10 weeks  The level of knowledge demonstrated in class by the instructors surrounding the online marketing platforms varied significantly as well  Google Adwords  Facebook  Twitter  etc  Only one out of three instructors had substantive talking points about the tools and context of use and could answer some of the algorithmic questions  The other instructors relied on useless  time wasting group exercises on non essential marketing topics  e g  How would you deal with a PR issue on Twitter  to occupy 2 hours of class time  Moreover  the course syllabus fails to mention that in order for you to derive as much hands on experience as you can from what little exposure there is to Google Analytics  you need to have your own working website  and sizable audience  in order to use Google Analytics for training  Otherwise  it s just either observing or using Google s store data for demo experience  For those not in the digital marketing field already  this is a major hurdle to hands on experience The above problems aside  my personal biggest gripe with the teaching approach was that it s apparently GA policy to NOT SHARE lecture notes ahead of class to enable students to come prepared about a topic or with questions  In hindsight  a better and more practical option would ve been taking a MOOC class  rather than believing that sinking  X amount of money would translate to meaningful structured learning
