# SQL Project

You were hired by Ironhack to perform an Analytics Consulting Project entitled: competitive landscape.

Your mission is to create and populate an appropriate database with many coding schools that are our competition, as well as business questions of interest (to be defined by you).

## Suggested Steps in the Project:

* Read this notebook and understand each function. Comment the code appropriately.

* Populate the list of schools with a wider variety of schools (how are you going to get the school ID?)

* Take a look at the obtained dataframes. What dimensions do you have? What keys do you have? How could the different dataframes be connected?

* Go back to the drawing board and try to create an entity relationship diagram for tables available.

* Once you have the schemas you want, you will need to:
  - create the suitable SQL queries to create the tables and populate them
  - run these queries using the appropriate Python connectors
  
## Suggested Deliverables

* 5-6 minute presentation of data model created, decision process and business analysis proposed

* exported .sql file with the final schema

* Supporting python files used to generate all logic

* High level documentation explaining tables designed and focusing on update methods
